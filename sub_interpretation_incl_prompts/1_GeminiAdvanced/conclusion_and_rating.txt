Conclusion by LLM
This replication study investigated the utilization of large language models (LLMs) to replicate the results of a prototype XGBoost model for vessel turnaround time (VTT) prediction in the context of the Hong Kong Port (HKP).  The LLM, Gemini Advanced, was tasked with replicating the study's methodology, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model setup, and performance evaluation.

While the LLM demonstrated proficiency in several areas of data preparation and model execution, the results indicated lower accuracy compared to the prototype XGBoost model. The LLM's model achieved an RMSE of 6.48 hours, MAE of 3.65 hours, and an R-squared of 0.49, compared to the prototype's RMSE of 4.60 hours, MAE of 3.32 hours, and R-squared of 0.55.

Practical usage by LLM
Despite the performance differences, this study provides important insights into the potential of LLMs for maritime transportation research. The LLM's ability to successfully execute complex data processing and modeling tasks highlights their capacity to assist researchers in such domains. However, the results underscore that careful tuning and domain-specific adjustments may be needed to achieve optimal results from LLMs in this context.

Future research by LLM
This work opens several avenues for further investigation:

LLM Refinement: Experimenting with different LLM architectures, hyperparameter tuning (e.g., temperature, length, repetition penalty), and context length adjustments could potentially improve LLM performance on this task.

Ensemble Methods: Combining LLM predictions with traditional machine learning models in an ensemble framework might enhance overall predictive accuracy.

Feature Engineering: Exploring the inclusion of additional features, such as weather conditions or real-time port congestion data, could contribute to more robust VTT predictions.

Overall, this replication study demonstrates the potential of LLMs as a tool within maritime transportation research, while also highlighting the importance of ongoing refinement and experimentation to achieve the best possible results.
