Prompt: ﻿﻿﻿Hey. I have read a paper with the following abstract:


<start abstract>

Uncertainty in vessel turnaround time (VTT) is troublesome and would reduce the operational efficiency in port management, potentially causing economic losses. Despite vessels generally providing their estimated departure time (EDT), there is frequently a considerable difference between the EDT and the actual departure time (ADT) of vessels due to various factors such as unexpected port handling inefficiency. This variability complicates the coordination of efficient port operations. Our research aims to address this issue by employing an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to predict the VTT, using vessel arrival and departure data at the Hong Kong Port for the year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. The proposed machine learning approach can provide more accurate predictions on VTT on average compared to the EDT data reported by vessels themselves, with a substantial reduction in both mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 23% (from 5.1 h to 3.9 h) and 24% (from 8.0 h to 6.1 h), respectively. These results present a significant leap forward in the predictive capabilities for the VTT and lay the foundation for further research into improving vessel scheduling efficiency, reducing port congestion and enhancing overall port performance.

<end abstract>


I would like to replicate this paper. What should I do and where should I start? Please be my personal assistant and guide me through the process. I can provide other parts of this paper if you need to know them.
Response: Great, thank you for providing that information! To begin replicating this study, we will first have to gather data on vessel arrival times at a port in question (in Hong Kong), as well as any available departure time and actual turnaround time data from the same vessels over an extended period of time. We can then use machine learning techniques such as XGBoost regression model or other models like Random Forest, Neural Networks etc to predict VTT based on this historical dataset using appropriate feature engineering methods (such as selecting relevant features). Once we have a good predictive model for predicting the turnaround times accurately and consistently over time with low error rates(RMSE), then it can be used in scheduling port operations more efficiently.
Prompt: We have now done the preprocessing steps. We now need to go on to feature engineering. For step 4, feature engineering, the paper writes down this:

<start of description of feature engineering>
4.1. Feature engineering
Feature engineering is the process of leveraging domain knowledge to create more effective representations that capture the essence of a problem, with the goal of enhancing a model’s predictive capabilities. There are three key steps involved in our feature engineering process, namely feature selection, categorical feature encoding, and dataset splitting. ‘‘Feature selection’’ aims to identify the most relevant variables for prediction. ‘‘Categorical feature encoding’’ transforms categorical data into numerical format so that models can process them. Finally, ‘‘dataset splitting’’ divides the data into separate sets for training and testing, ensuring that the model can be trained and validated effectively. Each of these steps is explained in detail below.

4.1.1. Feature selection
To predict VTT, we assess and integrate five categories of features into vessel arrival dataset to establish a comprehensive training set: vessel generic features, temporal features, berth operational features and waterway characteristics. The actual VTT is designated as the ground truth label. The features used to construct the machine learning prediction model are detailed in Table 7 (this table names vessel generic features: beam, GT, length, max_draft, vesseltype; temporal features: ATA_day, ATA_hour, EDT_day, EDT_hour, EDT_season, ATA_season, Expected VTT; Berth operational features: ATA_inport, ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, vessel_delay; Waterway features: tidal level; Prediction target: Actual VTT). We have evaluated these features based on their demonstrated influence on VTT through factor analysis, ensuring each one contributes meaningfully to the predictive accuracy of our model. Below, we provide a rationale for including these particular features from the perspective of their influence on VTT and detail the specific parameters selected for our case study, along with the source data from which they are obtained, ensuring a comprehensive and data-driven approach to predicting VTT.

4.1.2. Temporal features
Temporal features like EDT and ATA significantly impact VTT. EDTs help in resource planning and allocation, ensuring efficient berth utilization. Therefore, deviations from these estimates can cause delays, affecting subsequent vessel schedules and increasing turnaround times. ATAs, indicating the vessel’s actual arrival, can disrupt operations if significantly different from expected times, leading to rushed or delayed operations and inefficient use of resources. Accurate EDT and ATA are vital for effective scheduling and coordination, allowing for predictive planning and thus better management of vessel flows. Expected VTT can be calculated from ATA and ETD and serves as an essential basis for VTT evaluation and prediction. Moreover, port operational efficiency and busyness vary across different weeks, time slots, and seasons. Temporal features in ETD and ATA can serve as a basis to better assess VTT, accommodating for these variations and improving the overall efficiency and predictability of port operations. In the case study, the vessel arrival and departure information provided by the Hong Kong Marine Department website includes these time-related temporal information (e.g., ETA, ATA and their upload time) for ships in port.

4.1.3. Categorical feature encoding
Feature encoding of categorical data is a critical component of the data engineering pipeline (Zheng and Casari, 2018). Categorical data are non-numeric and often subdivided into groups. Consider, for example, the category of ‘‘vessel type’’. This is a form of categorical data that includes categories such as ‘‘container vessel’’, ‘‘bulk vessel’’ and ‘‘chemical tanker vessels’’. These values are maintained in a string format. Such features cannot be directly processed by machine learning algorithms. In this way, categorical feature encoding is employed to convert these strings into numbers suitable for input into machine learning models. Given the nature of the categorical data involved in this study, we primarily employ the following two feature encoding methods, one hot encoding and label encoding:
(1) One hot encoding: For a feature with m categories without order between them, after One hot encoding processing, that feature is extended to m new binary features and the original feature is deleted, with each new feature corresponding to a category. The m binary features are mutually exclusive and only one of them is set to 1 considering the real feature value, with 0 given to all of the (m − 1) features.
(2) Label encoding: In label encoding, we assign labels according to a hierarchy. For a feature with m categories, each category is mapped to a number between 0 and m − 1 after label encoding. The larger the assigned value, the higher the hierarchy of the category (Zheng and Casari, 2018).

Timestamps such as ATA, EDT and upload_time cannot be directly inputted into the prediction model. To tackle the issue, First, we employ One hot encoding to categorize the specific days of the week for ATA and EDT. Following this, we divide the precise time of ATA and EDT into three distinct and complimentary shifts using label encoding. These shifts are classified as: Shift 1 (from 0:00 to 8:00), Shift 2 (from 8:00 to 16:00) and Shift 3 (from 16:00 to 24:00) (Yu et al., 2018). We also used one hot encoding to label the season information corresponding to the ATA and EDT: December, January and February are labeled as winter, March, April and May as spring, June, July and August as summer, and September, October and November as autumn. The description of the categorical features is illustrated in Table 8.

4.1.4. Dataset splitting
HKP is primarily a container port that provides services to container vessels including container loading and unloading, which involves berth and crane allocation amongst other port operations. In this research, we mainly explore the prediction of VTT for container vessels at the HKP. Before splitting the dataset, we first filter out container vessels from all arriving ships based on the vessel type. Initially, there are 14,975 entries of vessel arrival data. After the filtering process, we have 10,001 records related to container vessels. Given that our dataset involves historical delay data related to vessels and berths, we cannot split the data randomly as is traditionally done. Instead, We use the 2022 ship arrival data as the training set and data from January 2023 to March 2023 as the test set. After this division, the training set consists of 8,178 data records and the prediction set consists of 1,823 data records.

<end of description of feature engineering>


Can you guide me through this feature engineering as done in the paper, step by step?

Response: Sure! The first thing we need to do is select relevant features for our model based on domain knowledge and past research studies related to berth allocation at container ports. Can I ask what specific information would be helpful here regarding your study or project goals with this dataset of vessel arrival data, so that I can better understand how the feature engineering should proceed?
Prompt: I think we should start with merging all my datasets to get all features as described by the paper (vessel generic features: beam, GT, length, max_draft, vesseltype; temporal features: ATA_day, ATA_hour, EDT_day, EDT_hour, EDT_season, ATA_season, Expected VTT; Berth operational features: ATA_inport, ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, vessel_delay; Waterway features: tidal level; Prediction target: Actual VTT)

The paper writes this about the ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay and vessel_delay features:

<start of section from the paper>
The average vessel delay refers to the average VTT delay for the particular vessel in the dataset, which is updated each time when the vessel arrives at the port. The average berth delay is divided into ATA berth delay and EDT berth delay. ATA berth delay refers to the average VTT delay time for the berth at which the vessel arrives. The EDT berth delay refers to the average VTT delay time for the berth at which the vessel reports its EDT. The specific method for calculating the delay is defined as follows: if a vessel is associated with multiple arrival reports in the dataset, the delay data related to the first arrival is the absolute difference between the vessel ADT and the corresponding EDT. For the second arrival, the delay value is the average of the VTT delay for the first two arrivals. This pattern continues, with each subsequent delay value being calculated as the average delay of all previous arrivals.

Response: Sure! Here's some sample code to get you started with merging your datasets using Python: 
```python
import pandas as pd # import necessary libraries here
# merge1 = pd.read_csv('merged_dataset.csv')  # read in first dataset and store it into a variable 'merge' (assuming this is the name of one column)
 merged2=pd.read_csv("inport_count.csv")   same as above for second CSV file 
alldata = pd.concat([merged1, merge2], ignore_index=True )  combine both datasets and store in a new variable 'alldata' (assuming this is the name of one column) 
 # now you can access all features using code like below:

 print(merge['VESSEL_NAME'])   # prints vessel names
print('Tide Height', merge.loc[0, "ATA_TIME"])  prints tide height for first row in merged dataset (assuming 'tidal level' is the name of one column) 
 # etc... 
```
Prompt: The data should be merged on common columns. please write code to do that
Response: Sure! Here's some sample Python code using pandas library:  (Assuming your CSV files have headers and are named 'merged_dataset', "inport_count", etc.) 
```python 
 # read in first dataset (CSV file) into a DataFrame object called merge1. Assuming column names include VESSEL_NAME, CALL_SIGN... for vessel generic features; ATA_TIME/EDT_BERTH/*next port* columns as temporal and berth operational data
merge1 = pd.read_csv('merged_dataset', header=None) 
 # read in second dataset (CSV file) into a DataFrame object called merge2 using the same method above 
alldata =pd.concat([df, df], ignore_index=True )  combine both datasets and store as new variable 'alldata' by concatenating each dataframe with itself on common columns 
 # now you can access all features in a single DataFrame object called "alldata" using code like below:
print(merge1['VESSEL_NAME'])   prints vessel names 
# etc...  for any column of interest (e.g., Vessel Type, Gross Tonnage)
Prompt: this code unfortunately does not work.

 df['VESSEL_NAME']  # add new column for vessel names from merged datasets 
df = pd.read_csv('merged_dataset', header=None) # read in second and third data into a DataFrame object called alldata using the same method above 

 print(allfeatures[['beam','GT','length']:]) prints beam, GT
