I have read a paper with the following abstract:\n\n\n<start abstract>\n\nUncertainty in vessel turnaround time (VTT) is troublesome and would reduce the operational efficiency in port management, potentially causing economic losses. Despite vessels generally providing their estimated departure time (EDT), there is frequently a considerable difference between the EDT and the actual departure time (ADT) of vessels due to various factors such as unexpected port handling inefficiency. This variability complicates the coordination of efficient port operations. Our research aims to address this issue by employing an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to predict the VTT, using vessel arrival and departure data at the Hong Kong Port for the year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. The proposed machine learning approach can provide more accurate predictions on VTT on average compared to the EDT data reported by vessels themselves, with a substantial reduction in both mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 23% (from 5.1 h to 3.9 h) and 24% (from 8.0 h to 6.1 h), respectively. These results present a significant leap forward in the predictive capabilities for the VTT and lay the foundation for further research into improving vessel scheduling efficiency, reducing port congestion and enhancing overall port performance.\n\n<end abstract>\n\n\nI would like to replicate this paper.

Dataset description\n\nThe Hong Kong Marine Department updates the arrival and depar- ture information for ocean-going vessels daily on its website (Hong Kong Marine Department, 2022) that is publicly accessible. The website contains five files: vessels arrived in the last 36 h, vessels due to arrive in the next 36 h, in port vessels, vessels departed in the last 36 h and vessels intending to depart the HKP in the next 36 h. The available data, their explanations and the frequency of data updating are shown in Tables 1 and 2. For the subsequent quantitative analysis and prediction of VTT, we have collected all related data from January 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 for our analysis. The ATA, EDT and ADT datasets contain 28,126, 18,365 and 19,430 records, respectively. As indicated in the data description above, the ATA, EDT and ADT data records reported by a vessel are stored in different files. The expected VTT for a port call is the difference between the EDT and ATA for that particular voyage, while the actual VTT is the difference between the ADT and ATA. Therefore, in order to quantify the specific duration of the VTT, further data pre-processing is required.\n\n3.3. Data collecting and pre-processing\n\nSince the calculation of both the actual and expected VTT involves the ATA, we utilize the ATA data as the reference during the data matching process. That is, we assign the corresponding ADT and EDT data to each ATA record. The basic steps for data pre-processing in VTT analysis are as follows: (1) Obtain ATA, EDT and ADT data: Hong Kong Marine Department uploads five files containing the arrival and departure information of ocean-going vessels on the government website on a daily basis (Hong Kong Marine Department, 2022). To pair a vessels\u2019 ATA with ADT data, as well as ATA with EDT for further analysis, the first step is to gather these ATA, EDT and ADT data from separate folders. (2) Unify the time format in the datasets: The time formats in different datasets may vary. The time for- mats for ATA, EDT, ADT and upload time are standardized to \u2018\u2018Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second\u2019\u2019. All records with miss- ing time information are removed from the dataset. (3) Delete records with an ATA later than its upload time: As the system records and uploads a vessel\u2019s ATA after it arrives at the HKP, the upload time of the ATA data will always be later than the ATA itself. If the ATA is earlier than the upload time, it can be considered inaccurate caused by system recording errors. Utilizing such erroneous ATA data as the ground truth value could adversely affect the subsequent vessel arrival analyses and predictions. Therefore, such data are removed from the ATA dataset.(4) Drop duplicated data from the datasets: The port system consistently updates vessel arrival and departure data on a daily basis, ensuring coverage for the upcoming 36 h. For each ship arrival and departure, the corresponding records of ATA, EDT and ADT are created. However, after merg- ing the data, we noticed that a single ship\u2019s arrival might cor- respond to multiple reported ATA, EDT, or ADT records, each with a different upload time.2 For these duplicate records, we only retain the first record of ATA and ADT data and delete the subsequent ones. Regarding the EDT data, when we en- counter multiple EDT data records reported by the same vessel, we choose to keep all unique EDT records. These records are valuable as they reflect changes in the ship\u2019s departure schedule, providing critical information for our predictive analyses. How- ever, if an EDT record remains consistent across multiple reports and only the upload time of EDT data changes, we eliminate the duplicates, keeping only the initial instance of the duplicated EDT. This approach is based on our assessment that the upload time of the EDT does not affect in our prediction models, and keeping duplicates would just make our training dataset bigger without helping our models. (5) Match the ATA and ADT data of each vessel in chronological order: During a voyage, a vessel\u2019s ADT is always later than its ATA. To match a vessel\u2019s ATA and ADT data, we first filter the relevant ATA and ADT data for each ship based on the call sign from the datasets. Next, we sort a vessel\u2019s ATA records in chronological order. For each ATA record, if the ATA precedes the ADT and the time difference between them is less than 3 days,3 we consider them as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching. (6) Match the ATA and EDT data of each vessel in chronological order: This step is similar to the previous ADT matching step. We first use call sign to sort the ATA data and ADT data for the targeted vessel, but what we compare in the next step are the ATA data and the upload time of the EDT data. Specifically, for each ATA record, if the upload time of the EDT data plus one day is earlier than the ATA data and the time difference between the upload time of the EDT and ATA data is less than 5 days,4 we considerthem as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching. (7) Delete ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT Upon completing the pairing process, any ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT are considered erroneous and are deleted. This circumstance might occur because either the system records the vessel\u2019s ATA but fails to record the corre- sponding EDT or ADT, or the vessel remains docked at the port and thus does don the corresponding ADT and EDT data. The number of ATA, EDT and ADT records before and after matching is summarized in Table 3.\n<end of description of pre-processing>\n\nCan you guide me through this preprocessing as done in the paper, step by step?\n\n", "status": "success"}, "summary": "Requested and received detailed information on data preprocessing steps from the study's methodology section."}, {"action": {"name": "ask_user", "args": {"question": "Let's begin by collecting the necessary datasets for the Hong Kong Port, focusing on ATA, EDT, and ADT data.

We first use call sign to sort the ATA data and ETD data for the targeted vessel, but what we compare in the next step are the ATA time and the upload time of the ETD data. Specifically, for each ATA record, if the upload time of the ETD data plus one day is later than the ATA data and the time difference between the upload time of the ETD and ATA data is less than 5 days we consider them as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching.\n\nI have these CSVs:\nATA_step3_no_dupes.csv.csv, it has columns (I have included some sample rows): \nVESSEL_NAME\tCALL_SIGN\tVESSEL_MAX_DRAFT\tATA_TIME\tBERTH\tAGENT_NAME\tUPLOAD_TIME\tFLAG\tLAST_PORT\nMTM DUBLIN\t9V6800\t11.32\t2021-12-31 18:27:00\tPT\tMTMM (HONG KONG) LIMITED\t2022-01-02 06:09:00\tSINGAPORE\tFANGCHENG, GX\nEUGEN MAERSK\tOXOS2\t12\t2021-12-31 19:08:00\tWL\tCOSCO SHIPPING AGENCY (HONG KONG) CO LIMITED\t2022-01-02 06:09:00\tDENMARK\tOTHER, OMAN\nBW HUDSON\t9V2881\t14\t2021-12-31 19:30:00\tSINO\tMTMM (HONG KONG) LIMITED\t2022-01-02 06:09:00\tSINGAPORE\tMAILIAO\n\nETD_step2_no_dupes.csv, it has columns (I have included some sample rows): \nAGENT_NAME\tCALL_SIGN\tCURRENT_LOCATION\tFLAG\tUPLOAD_TIME\tETD_TIME\tVESSEL_NAME\tNEXT_PORT\nT.S.
