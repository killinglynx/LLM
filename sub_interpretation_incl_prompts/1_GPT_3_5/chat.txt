Hey. Recently I have let LLMs try to replicate a study made by Zhong, of which the introduction is this:

<start introduction>
Maritime transport is an indispensable component of global trade and the engine of globalization. According to statistics of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, over 90% of the world’s trade is carried by sea, underpinning international commerce by providing an economical and efficient mode of transport (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2021; Tian et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023). Ports serve as pivotal nodes in maritime transportation and global supply chain, facilitating the exchange of goods across nations (Wang et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2024; Feng et al.,2022). The efficiency of these ports directly impacts the flow of international trade. A key metric that measures such efficiency is the vessel turnaround time (VTT), which represents the total time a vessel spends in a port from arrival at the anchorage or berth to departure from the port. The optimization of VTT is not merely a measure of a port’s operational efficiency; it is also an indicator of the port’s ability to contribute effectively to the global supply chain. A shorter VTT implies quicker movement of goods and thus a shorter schedule for vessels, reducing delays and enhancing the overall supply chain productivity. Conversely, longer VTTs can lead to bottlenecks and congestion, affecting not only the specific port’s operations but also having a cascading impact on global trade networks. The turnaround of a vessel
encompasses multiple processes like berthing, cargo unloading and loading and all the necessary documentation procedures and the VTT has far-reaching implications on port efficiency, cost-effectiveness and competitiveness. In daily port operation, vessels typically report their estimated departure time (EDT) data before leaving a port. However, this EDT is often significantly different from the actual departure time (ADT) data due to numerous unpredictable factors, such as unexpected port operational inefficiency and congestion. These deviations between EDT and ADT introduce uncertainties and inaccuracies to the estimation of VTT. Consequently, these inaccuracies can lead to significant vessel departure delays, increased port congestion and escalated operational expenses. This not only adversely impacts the competitiveness of shipping companies and ports, but also, by extension, hampers international trade. To reduce the inaccuracies and uncertainty of VTT prediction. The improved EDT data can subsequently aid ports in executing berth allocation more efficiently. This significantly benefits the decision-making process in port operations.

We use HKP as the case study in this research to predict VTT. Recognized as one of the world’s busiest ports, HKP handled approximately 18 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 2020. Typically, vessels preparing to leave the HKP report their EDT data within 36 h prior to their departure. Moreover, the port automatically records each vessel’s actual time of arrival (ATA) data upon its entry and ADT data upon its exit. Using this rich dataset, we develop an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to precisely predict VTT at the HKP. This prediction model considers multiple factors, including historical vessel arrival and departure data, historical vessel and port operational data, vessel generic features and tidal information. Our results highlight that the predictive model significantly minimizes the deviation error in VTT.

I have first made a prototype XGBoost model from all the data I gathered, which has the following results:

<start of results of prototype model>
Final dataset size: 7012 rows
RMSE: 4.60
MAE: 3.32
R-squared: 0.55
<end of results of prototype model>

Then I used an LLM to try replicating the results of the prototype model. I have written down some notes on the methodology used for the replication:

<start of notes on methodology>
-I have made standard prompts per topic.
- Standard prompts are fed, errors from code etc. are returned to the LLM. The LLM has the chance to improve itself until no notable improvements are given. Small hints are sometimes given. If code is OK and works, it is given a 'checkmark'.
- After its chances, I look if results are usable. If it is completely unusable, I execute the step myself and give a 'fail'. If the results are not as described in the paper, but it 'works', a 'partial pass' is given.
- The Context length of the LLMs is adjusted as such, so it performs with around 5-10 tokens on high-end hardware. This is due to the scope of usable local LLMs. The context length has high impact on performance.

Things that were not considered yet:
- Other LLMs
- Other LLM settings, like temperature, max length, repeat penalty.
- The effect of more or less information in prompts
- Multiple runs of every LLM

Conclusion

In this study, we embarked on the replication of a predictive model for vessel turnaround time (VTT) in the context of the Hong Kong Port (HKP), utilizing an innovative combination of machine learning methodologies. Our approach involved the initial development of a prototype XGBoost model followed by a meticulous attempt to replicate its results using a state-of-the-art language model (LLM).

Through a systematic process of data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model setup, we endeavored to ensure the fidelity of our replication efforts. While some challenges were encountered, particularly in certain aspects of feature engineering and dataset merging, our chosen LLM, ChatGPT 3.5, demonstrated remarkable adaptability and agility in resolving these issues. Notably, the LLM exhibited swift responsiveness, achieving commendable performance metrics comparable to, if not exceeding, those of the original XGBoost model.

Practical Usage

The successful replication of the predictive model for VTT holds significant implications for practical applications within the maritime industry, particularly in port operations management. By accurately forecasting VTT, port authorities can enhance operational efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and mitigate the risk of congestion and delays. The refined predictive capabilities afforded by our replicated model pave the way for informed decision-making, thereby bolstering the competitiveness and sustainability of port facilities such as the HKP on the global stage.

Furthermore, the expedient response time exhibited by our LLM underscores its potential as a valuable tool for real-time decision support in dynamic operational environments. Its capacity to rapidly adapt to evolving datasets and resolve challenges in model development augurs well for its integration into operational workflows, offering a versatile solution for port operators seeking to navigate the complexities of maritime logistics.

Future Research

Despite the strides made in this replication endeavor, several avenues for future research merit exploration. Firstly, the incorporation of additional data sources, such as weather patterns, vessel characteristics, and geopolitical factors, could enrich the predictive capabilities of the model and yield more nuanced insights into VTT dynamics. Moreover, the comparative analysis of different LLM architectures and settings warrants investigation to elucidate their respective strengths and limitations in replicating complex predictive models.

Furthermore, longitudinal studies tracking the performance of the replicated model over time would provide valuable insights into its robustness and reliability in practical deployment scenarios. Additionally, the extension of this research to encompass other ports and geographic regions would facilitate a broader understanding of the generalizability and transferability of the predictive framework.

In conclusion, our replication study underscores the potential of machine learning methodologies, augmented by advanced language models, to revolutionize predictive analytics in maritime logistics. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, we endeavor to empower port authorities with the tools and insights necessary to navigate the evolving landscape of global trade and secure a sustainable future for maritime transportation.
