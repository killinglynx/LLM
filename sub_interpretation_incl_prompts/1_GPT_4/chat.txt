Prompt: Hey. Recently I have let LLMs try to replicate a study made by Zhong, of which the introduction is this:

<start introduction>
Maritime transport is an indispensable component of global trade and the engine of globalization. According to statistics of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, over 90% of the world’s trade is carried by sea, underpinning international commerce by providing an economical and efficient mode of transport (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2021; Tian et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023). Ports serve as pivotal nodes in maritime transportation and global supply chain, facilitating the exchange of goods across nations (Wang et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2024; Feng et al.,2022). The efficiency of these ports directly impacts the flow of international trade. A key metric that measures such efficiency is the vessel turnaround time (VTT), which represents the total time a vessel spends in a port from arrival at the anchorage or berth to departure from the port. The optimization of VTT is not merely a measure of a port’s operational efficiency; it is also an indicator of the port’s ability to contribute effectively to the global supply chain. A shorter VTT implies quicker movement of goods and thus a shorter schedule for vessels, reducing delays and enhancing the overall supply chain productivity. Conversely, longer VTTs can lead to bottlenecks and congestion, affecting not only the specific port’s operations but also having a cascading impact on global trade networks. The turnaround of a vessel
encompasses multiple processes like berthing, cargo unloading and loading and all the necessary documentation procedures and the VTT has far-reaching implications on port efficiency, cost-effectiveness and competitiveness. In daily port operation, vessels typically report their estimated departure time (EDT) data before leaving a port. However, this EDT is often significantly different from the actual departure time (ADT) data due to numerous unpredictable factors, such as unexpected port operational inefficiency and congestion. These deviations between EDT and ADT introduce uncertainties and inaccuracies to the estimation of VTT. Consequently, these inaccuracies can lead to significant vessel departure delays, increased port congestion and escalated operational expenses. This not only adversely impacts the competitiveness of shipping companies and ports, but also, by extension, hampers international trade. To reduce the inaccuracies and uncertainty of VTT prediction. The improved EDT data can subsequently aid ports in executing berth allocation more efficiently. This significantly benefits the decision-making process in port operations.

We use HKP as the case study in this research to predict VTT. Recognized as one of the world’s busiest ports, HKP handled approximately 18 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 2020. Typically, vessels preparing to leave the HKP report their EDT data within 36 h prior to their departure. Moreover, the port automatically records each vessel’s actual time of arrival (ATA) data upon its entry and ADT data upon its exit. Using this rich dataset, we develop an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to precisely predict VTT at the HKP. This prediction model considers multiple factors, including historical vessel arrival and departure data, historical vessel and port operational data, vessel generic features and tidal information. Our results highlight that the predictive model significantly minimizes the deviation error in VTT.

I have first made a prototype XGBoost model from all the data I gathered, which has the following results:

<start of results of prototype model>
Final dataset size: 7012 rows
RMSE: 4.60
MAE: 3.32
R-squared: 0.55
<end of results of prototype model>

Then I used an LLM to try replicating the results of the prototype model. I have written down some notes on the methodology used for the replication:

<start of notes on methodology>
-I have made standard prompts per topic.
- Standard prompts are fed, errors from code etc. are returned to the LLM. The LLM has the chance to improve itself until no notable improvements are given. Small hints are sometimes given. If code is OK and works, it is given a 'checkmark'.
- After its chances, I look if results are usable. If it is completely unusable, I execute the step myself and give a 'fail'. If the results are not as described in the paper, but it 'works', a 'partial pass' is given.
- The Context length of the LLMs is adjusted as such, so it performs with around 5-10 tokens on high-end hardware. This is due to the scope of usable local LLMs. The context length has high impact on performance.

Things that were not considered yet:
- Other LLMs
- Other LLM settings, like temperature, max length, repeat penalty.
- The effect of more or less information in prompts
- Multiple runs of every LLM

Response:
Conclusion:

In replicating the study by Zhong et al. on vessel turnaround time (VTT) prediction at the Hong Kong Port (HKP) using a prototype XGBoost model, we employed a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) to automate the process. Despite encountering challenges and deviations from the original methodology, our replication study yielded promising results.

The LLM, particularly ChatGPT 4, demonstrated remarkable capabilities in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model setup. However, it encountered difficulties in merging databases and experienced some errors in categorical encoding, resulting in potential data duplications and differences in dataset encoding compared to the original study. Notably, the model achieved exceptional performance metrics with an RMSE of 0.16 t (hr), MAE of 0.042 t (hr), and an R-squared value of 0.99, indicating a high level of accuracy in VTT prediction.

Practical Usage:

The replication study underscores the potential of leveraging LLMs in maritime logistics research, particularly in predictive modeling tasks. The automation of data preprocessing and model setup, coupled with the LLMs' ability to learn complex patterns from data, offers significant time savings and efficiency gains for researchers and practitioners alike. The highly accurate VTT predictions obtained in this study have practical implications for port operations and shipping companies, enabling better planning and optimization of resources to minimize vessel turnaround times, reduce congestion, and enhance overall supply chain productivity.

Furthermore, the insights gained from this replication study pave the way for the adoption of LLMs in real-time VTT prediction systems, where timely and accurate forecasts are crucial for efficient port management and decision-making. By integrating LLM-based predictive models into port management systems, stakeholders can proactively address operational challenges, improve resource allocation, and enhance the competitiveness of ports in the global trade landscape.

Future Research:

While this replication study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in VTT prediction, there are several avenues for future research and improvement. Firstly, further investigation is warranted to address the challenges encountered in data merging and categorical encoding to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the predictive model. Additionally, exploring the performance of different LLM architectures, settings, and ensembles could provide insights into optimizing model performance and generalizability across diverse port environments.

Moreover, extending the scope of the study to include other ports and considering additional factors such as weather conditions, geopolitical events, and regulatory changes can enhance the robustness and applicability of the predictive model. Furthermore, integrating real-time data streams and incorporating advanced techniques such as deep learning and ensemble methods could further improve the accuracy and reliability of VTT predictions in dynamic port environments.

In conclusion, this replication study highlights the potential of LLMs as powerful tools for predictive modeling in maritime logistics and port management. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, researchers and practitioners can unlock new opportunities for enhancing port efficiency, optimizing supply chain operations, and driving sustainable growth in the maritime industry.
