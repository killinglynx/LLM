Conclusion:

In replicating the study by Zhong et al. on vessel turnaround time (VTT) prediction at the Hong Kong Port (HKP) using a prototype XGBoost model, we employed a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) to automate the process. Despite encountering challenges and deviations from the original methodology, our replication study yielded promising results.

The LLM, particularly ChatGPT 4, demonstrated remarkable capabilities in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model setup. However, it encountered difficulties in merging databases and experienced some errors in categorical encoding, resulting in potential data duplications and differences in dataset encoding compared to the original study. Notably, the model achieved exceptional performance metrics with an RMSE of 0.16 t (hr), MAE of 0.042 t (hr), and an R-squared value of 0.99, indicating a high level of accuracy in VTT prediction.

Practical Usage:

The replication study underscores the potential of leveraging LLMs in maritime logistics research, particularly in predictive modeling tasks. The automation of data preprocessing and model setup, coupled with the LLMs' ability to learn complex patterns from data, offers significant time savings and efficiency gains for researchers and practitioners alike. The highly accurate VTT predictions obtained in this study have practical implications for port operations and shipping companies, enabling better planning and optimization of resources to minimize vessel turnaround times, reduce congestion, and enhance overall supply chain productivity.

Furthermore, the insights gained from this replication study pave the way for the adoption of LLMs in real-time VTT prediction systems, where timely and accurate forecasts are crucial for efficient port management and decision-making. By integrating LLM-based predictive models into port management systems, stakeholders can proactively address operational challenges, improve resource allocation, and enhance the competitiveness of ports in the global trade landscape.

Future Research:

While this replication study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in VTT prediction, there are several avenues for future research and improvement. Firstly, further investigation is warranted to address the challenges encountered in data merging and categorical encoding to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the predictive model. Additionally, exploring the performance of different LLM architectures, settings, and ensembles could provide insights into optimizing model performance and generalizability across diverse port environments.

Moreover, extending the scope of the study to include other ports and considering additional factors such as weather conditions, geopolitical events, and regulatory changes can enhance the robustness and applicability of the predictive model. Furthermore, integrating real-time data streams and incorporating advanced techniques such as deep learning and ensemble methods could further improve the accuracy and reliability of VTT predictions in dynamic port environments.

In conclusion, this replication study highlights the potential of LLMs as powerful tools for predictive modeling in maritime logistics and port management. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, researchers and practitioners can unlock new opportunities for enhancing port efficiency, optimizing supply chain operations, and driving sustainable growth in the maritime industry.
