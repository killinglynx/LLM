Conclusion
The replication study, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to reconstruct a predictive analysis of Vessel Turnaround Time (VTT) originally developed using an XGBoost model, demonstrates significant advancements in the application of LLMs within the scope of predictive modeling in maritime logistics. The original model, centered around the Hong Kong Port (HKP), set a foundation by achieving an RMSE of 4.60, MAE of 3.32, and R-squared value of 0.55. 

The replication approach, leveraging the AutoGPT model, introduced an automated pre-processing, feature engineering, and model setup workflow which not only improved the efficiency of the replication process but also resulted in enhanced prediction accuracy, as evidenced by the improvements in RMSE to 3.95, MAE to 2.42, and R-squared value to 0.66. Despite the challenges in categorical encoding and feature selection, the LLM showcased its ability to autonomously execute and refine complex data processing tasks, underscoring the potential of such models to revolutionize various stages of data analysis. 

Practical usage
From a practical standpoint, the refined prediction capabilities of LLMs offer port authorities and maritime logistics companies a tool for more accurate and timely decision-making, directly contributing to the enhancement of port efficiency and the reduction of operational uncertainties. This replication study also prompts a reconsideration of traditional predictive modeling approaches in favor of flexible, adaptive, and intelligent computational models that can rapidly adjust to new data and evolving operational conditions. 

Future research
Future research should focus on refining the LLM approach by exploring other LLM architectures, settings, and prompt strategies to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of predictive models. Additionally, conducting multiple runs and applying the methodology across different ports and logistics scenarios would provide valuable insights into the generalizability and scalability of these approaches. Ultimately, this study paves the way for transformative changes in predictive modeling strategies in maritime logistics, highlighting the indispensable role of advanced computational models in optimizing global trade operations.
