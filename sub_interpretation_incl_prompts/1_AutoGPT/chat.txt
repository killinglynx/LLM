Prompt: Hey. Recently I have let LLMs try to replicate a study made by Zhong, of which the introduction is this:

<start introduction>
Maritime transport is an indispensable component of global trade and the engine of globalization. According to statistics of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, over 90% of the world’s trade is carried by sea, underpinning international commerce by providing an economical and efficient mode of transport (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2021; Tian et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023). Ports serve as pivotal nodes in maritime transportation and global supply chain, facilitating the exchange of goods across nations (Wang et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2024; Feng et al.,2022). The efficiency of these ports directly impacts the flow of international trade. A key metric that measures such efficiency is the vessel turnaround time (VTT), which represents the total time a vessel spends in a port from arrival at the anchorage or berth to departure from the port. The optimization of VTT is not merely a measure of a port’s operational efficiency; it is also an indicator of the port’s ability to contribute effectively to the global supply chain. A shorter VTT implies quicker movement of goods and thus a shorter schedule for vessels, reducing delays and enhancing the overall supply chain productivity. Conversely, longer VTTs can lead to bottlenecks and congestion, affecting not only the specific port’s operations but also having a cascading impact on global trade networks. The turnaround of a vessel
encompasses multiple processes like berthing, cargo unloading and loading and all the necessary documentation procedures and the VTT has far-reaching implications on port efficiency, cost-effectiveness and competitiveness. In daily port operation, vessels typically report their estimated departure time (EDT) data before leaving a port. However, this EDT is often significantly different from the actual departure time (ADT) data due to numerous unpredictable factors, such as unexpected port operational inefficiency and congestion. These deviations between EDT and ADT introduce uncertainties and inaccuracies to the estimation of VTT. Consequently, these inaccuracies can lead to significant vessel departure delays, increased port congestion and escalated operational expenses. This not only adversely impacts the competitiveness of shipping companies and ports, but also, by extension, hampers international trade. To reduce the inaccuracies and uncertainty of VTT prediction. The improved EDT data can subsequently aid ports in executing berth allocation more efficiently. This significantly benefits the decision-making process in port operations.

We use HKP as the case study in this research to predict VTT. Recognized as one of the world’s busiest ports, HKP handled approximately 18 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 2020. Typically, vessels preparing to leave the HKP report their EDT data within 36 h prior to their departure. Moreover, the port automatically records each vessel’s actual time of arrival (ATA) data upon its entry and ADT data upon its exit. Using this rich dataset, we develop an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to precisely predict VTT at the HKP. This prediction model considers multiple factors, including historical vessel arrival and departure data, historical vessel and port operational data, vessel generic features and tidal information. Our results highlight that the predictive model significantly minimizes the deviation error in VTT.

I have first made a prototype XGBoost model from all the data I gathered, which has the following results:

<start of results of prototype model>
Final dataset size: 7012 rows
RMSE: 4.60
MAE: 3.32
R-squared: 0.55
<end of results of prototype model>

Then I used an LLM to try replicating the results of the prototype model. I have written down some notes on the methodology used for the replication:

<start of notes on methodology>
-I have made standard prompts per topic.
- Standard prompts are fed, errors from code etc. are returned to the LLM. The LLM has the chance to improve itself until no notable improvements are given. Small hints are sometimes given. If code is OK and works, it is given a 'checkmark'.
- After its chances, I look if results are usable. If it is completely unusable, I execute the step myself and give a 'fail'. If the results are not as described in the paper, but it 'works', a 'partial pass' is given.
- The Context length of the LLMs is adjusted as such, so it performs with around 5-10 tokens on high-end hardware. This is due to the scope of usable local LLMs. The context length has high impact on performance.

Things that were not considered yet:
- Other LLMs
- Other LLM settings, like temperature, max length, repeat penalty.
- The effect of more or less information in prompts
- Multiple runs of every LLM

I want you to write the conclusion of this replication study, that I can use in my research paper. It should include a conclusion, practical usage and future research.

Response: The replication study, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to reconstruct a predictive analysis of Vessel Turnaround Time (VTT) originally developed using an XGBoost model, demonstrates significant advancements in the application of LLMs within the scope of predictive modeling in maritime logistics. The original model, centered around the Hong Kong Port (HKP), set a foundation by achieving an RMSE of 4.60, MAE of 3.32, and R-squared value of 0.55. 

The replication approach, leveraging the AutoGPT model, introduced an automated pre-processing, feature engineering, and model setup workflow which not only improved the efficiency of the replication process but also resulted in enhanced prediction accuracy, as evidenced by the improvements in RMSE to 3.95, MAE to 2.42, and R-squared value to 0.66. Despite the challenges in categorical encoding and feature selection, the LLM showcased its ability to autonomously execute and refine complex data processing tasks, underscoring the potential of such models to revolutionize various stages of data analysis. 

From a practical standpoint, the refined prediction capabilities of LLMs offer port authorities and maritime logistics companies a tool for more accurate and timely decision-making, directly contributing to the enhancement of port efficiency and the reduction of operational uncertainties. This replication study also prompts a reconsideration of traditional predictive modeling approaches in favor of flexible, adaptive, and intelligent computational models that can rapidly adjust to new data and evolving operational conditions. 

Future research should focus on refining the LLM approach by exploring other LLM architectures, settings, and prompt strategies to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of predictive models. Additionally, conducting multiple runs and applying the methodology across different ports and logistics scenarios would provide valuable insights into the generalizability and scalability of these approaches. Ultimately, this study paves the way for transformative changes in predictive modeling strategies in maritime logistics, highlighting the indispensable role of advanced computational models in optimizing global trade operations.
