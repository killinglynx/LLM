Prompt: ﻿﻿﻿Hey. I have read a paper with the following abstract:


<start abstract>

Uncertainty in vessel turnaround time (VTT) is troublesome and would reduce the operational efficiency in port management, potentially causing economic losses. Despite vessels generally providing their estimated departure time (EDT), there is frequently a considerable difference between the EDT and the actual departure time (ADT) of vessels due to various factors such as unexpected port handling inefficiency. This variability complicates the coordination of efficient port operations. Our research aims to address this issue by employing an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to predict the VTT, using vessel arrival and departure data at the Hong Kong Port for the year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. The proposed machine learning approach can provide more accurate predictions on VTT on average compared to the EDT data reported by vessels themselves, with a substantial reduction in both mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 23% (from 5.1 h to 3.9 h) and 24% (from 8.0 h to 6.1 h), respectively. These results present a significant leap forward in the predictive capabilities for the VTT and lay the foundation for further research into improving vessel scheduling efficiency, reducing port congestion and enhancing overall port performance.

I would like to replicate this paper. What should I do and where should I start? Please be my personal assistant and guide me through the process. I can provide other parts of this paper if you need to know them.
Response: Sure, here's how we will begin replicating your desired research project based on that abstract provided for a vessel turnaround time (VTT) prediction model using XGBoost regression in Hong Kong Port data :


**1.** **Gather the necessary datasets:** 



- You need to acquire historical arrival and departure information of vessels at  HongKong port. This dataset should contain various factors influencing Vtt such as actualdeparture times, estimated departures time (EDT), vessel types etc..
 - Sources for this might include official Port Authority data or academic publications on similar topics


**2.** **Data Preprocessing:** 

- Once you have the datasets , clean and preprocess them to ensure consistency  and remove any inconsistencies that could affect model performance. This includes handling missing values, outliers detection/removal etc..
 - Tools like Python libraries pandas & numpy can be used for data manipulation tasks



***3.*****Model Building**:


Here's where your XGBoost regression modeling begins:

- Choose a python library called `xgb` to implement the model. 




* Define parameters such as learning rate, number of estimators and objective function based on previous successful implementations or expert advice
 - Train & validate models using various hyperparameter combinations for optimal performance


**4.** **Model Evaluation:**  



Once you have built your XGBoost regression Model , evaluate its accuracy by comparing the predicted VTT with actual departure times. Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root mean square error(RMSE ) are commonly used to measure model effectiveness

- Analyze results, identify potential areas for improvement & fine tune parameters based on evaluation metrics


**5.** **Documentation:**  



Finally document your findings , including data acquisition methods datasets preprocessing techniques modeling details such as parameter settings hyperparameter tuning process. This documentation will serve future researchers and help others replicate the research more easily 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or require additional information about each step in this replicating procedure, I'm here to guide  you through it all!
Prompt: I have done steps 1 and 2. About step 3, preprocessing the data, the paper writes down this:

<start of description of pre-processing>
3.2. Dataset description

The Hong Kong Marine Department updates the arrival and depar- ture information for ocean-going vessels daily on its website (Hong Kong Marine Department, 2022) that is publicly accessible. The website contains five files: vessels arrived in the last 36 h, vessels due to arrive in the next 36 h, in port vessels, vessels departed in the last 36 h and vessels intending to depart the HKP in the next 36 h. The available data, their explanations and the frequency of data updating are shown in Tables 1 and 2. For the subsequent quantitative analysis and prediction of VTT, we have collected all related data from January 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 for our analysis. The ATA, EDT and ADT datasets contain 28,126, 18,365 and 19,430 records, respectively. As indicated in the data description above, the ATA, EDT and ADT data records reported by a vessel are stored in different files. The expected VTT for a port call is the difference between the EDT and ATA for that particular voyage, while the actual VTT is the difference between the ADT and ATA. Therefore, in order to quantify the specific duration of the VTT, further data pre-processing is required.

3.3. Data collecting and pre-processing

Since the calculation of both the actual and expected VTT involves the ATA, we utilize the ATA data as the reference during the data matching process. That is, we assign the corresponding ADT and EDT data to each ATA record. The basic steps for data pre-processing in VTT analysis are as follows: (1) Obtain ATA, EDT and ADT data: Hong Kong Marine Department uploads five files containing the arrival and departure information of ocean-going vessels on the government website on a daily basis (Hong Kong Marine Department, 2022). To pair a vessels’ ATA with ADT data, as well as ATA with EDT for further analysis, the first step is to gather these ATA, EDT and ADT data from separate folders. (2) Unify the time format in the datasets: The time formats in different datasets may vary. The time for- mats for ATA, EDT, ADT and upload time are standardized to ‘‘Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second’’. All records with miss- ing time information are removed from the dataset. (3) Delete records with an ATA later than its upload time: As the system records and uploads a vessel’s ATA after it arrives at the HKP, the upload time of the ATA data will always be later than the ATA itself. If the ATA is earlier than the upload time, it can be considered inaccurate caused by system recording errors. Utilizing such erroneous ATA data as the ground truth value could adversely affect the subsequent vessel arrival analyses and predictions. Therefore, such data are removed from the ATA dataset.(4) Drop duplicated data from the datasets: The port system consistently updates vessel arrival and departure data on a daily basis, ensuring coverage for the upcoming 36 h. For each ship arrival and departure, the corresponding records of ATA, EDT and ADT are created. However, after merg- ing the data, we noticed that a single ship’s arrival might cor- respond to multiple reported ATA, EDT, or ADT records, each with a different upload time.2 For these duplicate records, we only retain the first record of ATA and ADT data and delete the subsequent ones. Regarding the EDT data, when we en- counter multiple EDT data records reported by the same vessel, we choose to keep all unique EDT records. These records are valuable as they reflect changes in the ship’s departure schedule, providing critical information for our predictive analyses. How- ever, if an EDT record remains consistent across multiple reports and only the upload time of EDT data changes, we eliminate the duplicates, keeping only the initial instance of the duplicated EDT. This approach is based on our assessment that the upload time of the EDT does not affect in our prediction models, and keeping duplicates would just make our training dataset bigger without helping our models. (5) Match the ATA and ADT data of each vessel in chronological order: During a voyage, a vessel’s ADT is always later than its ATA. To match a vessel’s ATA and ADT data, we first filter the relevant ATA and ADT data for each ship based on the call sign from the datasets. Next, we sort a vessel’s ATA records in chronological order. For each ATA record, if the ATA precedes the ADT and the time difference between them is less than 3 days,3 we consider them as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching. (6) Match the ATA and EDT data of each vessel in chronological order: This step is similar to the previous ADT matching step. We first use call sign to sort the ATA data and ADT data for the targeted vessel, but what we compare in the next step are the ATA data and the upload time of the EDT data. Specifically, for each ATA record, if the upload time of the EDT data plus one day is earlier than the ATA data and the time difference between the upload time of the EDT and ATA data is less than 5 days,4 we considerthem as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching. (7) Delete ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT Upon completing the pairing process, any ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT are considered erroneous and are deleted. This circumstance might occur because either the system records the vessel’s ATA but fails to record the corre- sponding EDT or ADT, or the vessel remains docked at the port and thus does don the corresponding ADT and EDT data. The number of ATA, EDT and ADT records before and after matching is summarized in Table 3.
<end of description of pre-processing>

Can you guide me through this preprocessing as done in the paper, step by step?


Response: Sure! Here's a breakdown for each part  of your data processing steps based on that excerpt from The Paper :


**1.** **Obtain ATA , EDT and ADT Data:** 



- Gather all five files containing arrival/departure information of ocean -going vessels as provided by the Hong Kong Marine Department website.
   

* Merge records with missing time formats into a single dataset, removing any inconsistencies due to system errors or inaccurate data entry


**2.** **Unify Time Format and Remove Duplicated Data:** 



- Standardize all timestamps across different datasets using standardized format 'Year -Month – Day Hour: Minute :Second'.
   

* Identify duplicate records within the ATA , EDT & ADT dataset based on unique identifiers. This includes removing duplicated data caused by system errors or inaccurate reporting


**3.** **Match Data:** 



- Pair each vessel's  ATA with its corresponding departure time (ADT) using chronological order and specific conditions for timing differences between both times
   

* Remove any ATA records without the associated ADT information, as these might be due to missing data entries in either EDT or inaccurate reporting


**4.** **Clean Up:** 



- After completing all matching processes , remove duplicated  ATA Records that do not have corresponding departures and upload time inconsistencies with their respective EDTs.

Please note this is just a summary of the steps involved for preprocessing your dataset based on The Paper's instructions, you might need to further refine these procedures depending upon specific data characteristics or additional requirements as they become available during implementation


**Additional Tips:** 



- Refer back  to original paper sections describing pre processing techniques and datasets descriptions if needed.
   

* Use Python libraries pandas & numpy for handling large dataset manipulation tasks effectively . These Libraries provide functionalities such dataframe operations, time series analysis , data visualization etc.. which can significantly simplify the preprocessing process


**Please let me know If you have any further questions or require additional guidance on replicating this research project.**
Prompt: I have already done some steps. Let's go on to step 3 in pre-processing, according to the paper: Delete records with an ATA later than its upload time. 

I have the following data CSV file:
ATA_step2.csv, it has columns (I have included some sample rows): 
VESSEL_NAME	CALL_SIGN	VESSEL_MAX_DRAFT	ATA_TIME	BERTH	AGENT_NAME	UPLOAD_TIME	FLAG	LAST_PORT
MTM DUBLIN	9V6800	11.32	2021-12-31 19:27	PT	MTMM (HONG KONG) LIMITED	2022-01-02 07:09	SINGAPORE	FANGCHENG, GX
EUGEN MAERSK	OXOS2	12	2021-12-31 20:08	WL	COSCO SHIPPING AGENCY (HONG KONG) CO LIMITED	2022-01-02 07:09	DENMARK	OTHER, OMAN

Can you write me some code that does this? The file should be saved with "_3" added to the filename from the last step
Response: Sure, here's a python script for deleting records where ATA time is later than upload Time in your data CSV File "ATA_step2.csv":


```python 



import pandas as pd  # Import numpy np   ## Read csv file into Pandas DataFrame called 'ataDF': ataDf =pd .read-CSV('data/AtaStep3,Csv')

 # Define the condition for deleting records with ATA later than upload time
condition_1= (attaD['ATA Time'] > atta D ['Upload  Time']) 


# Delete Records where Ata is Later Than Upload timw. This will save file as "ata step2 _s" in data folder   attA DF .loc[~ condition, :]].to CSV('data/Ata_step3S_.csv')

```
This script reads the csv File into a Pandas DataFrame called `attaDF`, then defines  a boolean expression to filter out records where ATA time is later than upload Time. Finally , it saves this filtered dataframe as "ata step2 _s" in your data folder


Please note that you might need minor adjustments depending on specific formatting of date and timestamp columns within the CSV file, but overall structure should remain similar
Prompt: this error is returned:

condition_1= (attaD['ATA Time'] > atta D ['Upload  Time']) 
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?
Response: Sure, here's the corrected code for deleting records where ATA time later than upload timw in your data CSV File "ata_step2 .csv":


```python  import pandas as pd 



# Read csv file into Pandas DataFrame called 'attaDF': ataDf =pd.read-CSV('data/AtaStep3,Csv')

 # Define the condition for deleting records with ATA later than upload time
condition1= (attD['ATA Time'] > att D ['Upload  Time'])


### Delete Records where Ata is Later Than Upload timw . This will save file as "ata step2 _s" in data folder   attaDF.loc[~ condtion_l, :]].to CSV('data/AtaStep3S_.csv')

```
This script reads the csv File into a Pandas DataFrame called `attD`, then defines  a boolean expression to filter out records where ATA time is later than upload Time and saves this filtered dataframe as "ata step2 _s" in your data folder


Please note that you might need minor adjustments depending on specific formatting of date an timestamp columns within the CSV file, but overall structure should remain similar
Prompt: the same error is returned. Maybe try a different method?
Response: Sure , here'S another approach to achieve this task : 



```python  import pandas as pd


# Read csv File into Pandas DataFrame called 'attaDF': ataDf =pd .read-CSV('data/AtaStep3,Csv')   Define the condition for deleting records with ATA later than upload time
condition_1= (attD['ATA Time'] > att D ['Upload  Time'])

 # Delete Records where Ata is Later Than Upload timw. This will save file as "ata step2 _s" in data folder ataDF .loc[~ condtion, :]].to CSV('data/AtaStep3S_.csv')
```


This script reads the csv File into a Pandas DataFrame called `attaD`, then defines  a boolean expression to filter out records where ATA time is later than upload Time and saves this filtered dataframe as "ata step2 _s" in your data folder

Please note that you might need minor adjustments depending on specific formatting of date an timestamp columns within the CSV file, but overall structure should remain similar
