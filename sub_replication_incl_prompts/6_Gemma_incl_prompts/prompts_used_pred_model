Prompt: ﻿﻿﻿Hey. I have read a paper with the following abstract:


<start abstract>

Uncertainty in vessel turnaround time (VTT) is troublesome and would reduce the operational efficiency in port management, potentially causing economic losses. Despite vessels generally providing their estimated departure time (EDT), there is frequently a considerable difference between the EDT and the actual departure time (ADT) of vessels due to various factors such as unexpected port handling inefficiency. This variability complicates the coordination of efficient port operations. Our research aims to address this issue by employing an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to predict the VTT, using vessel arrival and departure data at the Hong Kong Port for the year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. The proposed machine learning approach can provide more accurate predictions on VTT on average compared to the EDT data reported by vessels themselves, with a substantial reduction in both mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 23% (from 5.1 h to 3.9 h) and 24% (from 8.0 h to 6.1 h), respectively. These results present a significant leap forward in the predictive capabilities for the VTT and lay the foundation for further research into improving vessel scheduling efficiency, reducing port congestion and enhancing overall port performance.

I would like to replicate this paper. What should I do and where should I start? Please be my personal assistant and guide me through the process. I can provide other parts of this paper if you need to know them.
Response: Sure, here's how we will go about replicating that researchpaper on vessel turnaround time (VTT): 


**1) Data Acquisition:**  The first step is acquiring all necessary data for model training and testing purposes.<br> - You should gather historical arrival/departure information of vessels at the Hong Kong Port in both year-20XX format. This will serve as your primary dataset to build upon later during modeling process

 ** 
**1) Data Preprocessing:** Once you have collected all data, it's time for preprocessing.<br> - Analyze and clean up any inconsistencies or errors within this rawdata before moving forward with model training


  ***   The next step involves building the machine learning Model.***



* ***Model Building**: Employ an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regressionmodel to predict VTT. This is a widely used technique for modeling complex relationships between variables and has been shown successful in similar tasks.<br> - You will need libraries like pandas, scikit-learn or PyTorch depending on your chosen programming language


* ***Model Training**: Train the X GB model using historical data as input features to predict VTT. Fine tune hyperparameters such learning rate , number of estimators etc for optimal performance

**3) Model Evaluation:** After training and tuning  the models parameters, evaluate its accuracy against actual departure times.<br> - Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root mean square error(RMSE ) or other relevant indicators to assess the model's effectiveness


 **4)** Conclusion: Based on your findings from evaluation process , draw conclusions about how well this machine learning approach performs compared with existing methods and discuss potential implications for improving port operations efficiency.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional information on each step of the process, I'm here to guide  you through replicating this research paper successfully
Prompt: We have already the preprocessing steps, all data is ready, only the XGBoost code has to be written and the performance has to be assessed. About that, the paper writes down this:

<start of description of model development>
The XGBoost model encompasses several hyperparameters. To obtain the optimal prediction results in this study, we tune the following main hyperparameters: learning_rate, n_estimators, max_depth, sub_sample and colsample_bytree.

(Table 15) Adopted hyperparameters for the XGBoost model:
Hyperparameter learning_rate max_depth n_estimators sub_sample colsample_bytree
Selected value 0.01 6 1000 0.5 1.0

4.2.3. Model assessment metrics
For offline evaluation of VTT prediction, the model’s output is considered as the predicted value, while the difference between the ADT and ATA is treated as the ground truth of the actual VTT. To provide a comprehensive assessment of the model’s performance, three commonly adopted metrics are utilized: RMSE, the mean absolute error(MAE) and R-squared (R2).

I have two CSVs, database_test.csv and database_train.csv. They both look like this:

The 'Turnaround' is the XGBoost prediction goal.
