Prompt: ﻿﻿﻿Hey. I have read a paper with the following abstract:


<start abstract>

Uncertainty in vessel turnaround time (VTT) is troublesome and would reduce the operational efficiency in port management, potentially causing economic losses. Despite vessels generally providing their estimated departure time (EDT), there is frequently a considerable difference between the EDT and the actual departure time (ADT) of vessels due to various factors such as unexpected port handling inefficiency. This variability complicates the coordination of efficient port operations. Our research aims to address this issue by employing an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to predict the VTT, using vessel arrival and departure data at the Hong Kong Port for the year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. The proposed machine learning approach can provide more accurate predictions on VTT on average compared to the EDT data reported by vessels themselves, with a substantial reduction in both mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 23% (from 5.1 h to 3.9 h) and 24% (from 8.0 h to 6.1 h), respectively. These results present a significant leap forward in the predictive capabilities for the VTT and lay the foundation for further research into improving vessel scheduling efficiency, reducing port congestion and enhancing overall port performance.

I would like to replicate this paper. What should I do and where should I start? Please be my personal assistant and guide me through the process. I can provide other parts of this paper if you need to know them.
Response: Sure, let's get started! To replicate this paper, we will first need to gather some information about the data used in the study. Can you please tell me what kind of data was used?
Prompt: I have done some steps already, like preprocessing. I think we should continue with merging all my datasets to get all features as described by the paper (vessel generic features: beam, GT, length, max_draft, vesseltype; temporal features: ATA_day, ATA_hour, EDT_day, EDT_hour, EDT_season, ATA_season, Expected VTT; Berth operational features: ATA_inport, ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, vessel_delay; Waterway features: tidal level; Prediction target: Actual VTT)

The paper writes this about the ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay and vessel_delay features, since they should still be calculated:

<start of section from the paper>
The average vessel delay refers to the average VTT delay for the particular vessel in the dataset, which is updated each time when the vessel arrives at the port. The average berth delay is divided into ATA berth delay and EDT berth delay. ATA berth delay refers to the average VTT delay time for the berth at which the vessel arrives. The EDT berth delay refers to the average VTT delay time for the berth at which the vessel reports its EDT. The specific method for calculating the delay is defined as follows: if a vessel is associated with multiple arrival reports in the dataset, the delay data related to the first arrival is the absolute difference between the vessel ADT and the corresponding EDT. For the second arrival, the delay value is the average of the VTT delay for the first two arrivals. This pattern continues, with each subsequent delay value being calculated as the average delay of all previous arrivals.

I now have these CSVs:

Can you write me code to get all these features in one database, step by step? The output should include these features: (vessel generic features: beam, GT, length, max_draft, vesseltype; temporal features: Expected VTT; Berth operational features: ATA_inport, ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, vessel_delay; Waterway features: tidal level; Prediction target: Actual VTT). ATA_TIME and ETD_TIME are also needed for the next step.
Response: To get all these features in one database, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the vessel generic feature data from `vesselgenericfeatures.csv` into a pandas DataFrame called `df_gen`.
2. Load the temporal feature data from `inport_count.csv`, `ata_tidal_final.csv`, and `all_shipdata_final.csv` into separate pandas DataFrames, one for each file. Let's call these DataFrames `df_inport`, `df_tide`, and `df_ships`.
3. Merge the three dataframes on their common column (`ATA_TIME`) using a left join to include all records from both tables in the final result, even if there is no corresponding record in one of the other tables. Let's call this merged DataFrame `merged_data`.
4. Extract the vessel generic features (beam, GT, length, max\_draft, and vesseltype) from `df_gen` into a new pandas Series called `vessel_features`.
5. Extract the temporal features (`Expected VTT`, `Berth operational features`: `ATA_inport`, `EDT_berth_delay`, and `Vessel_Delay`) from `merged_data` into separate pandas DataFrames, one for each feature type. Let's call these dataframes `df_expected_vtt`, `df_ata_inport`, `df_edt_berth_delay`, and `df_vessel_delay`.
6. Extract the waterway features (`Tidal Level`) from `df_tide` into a new pandas Series
Prompt: Can you write me code to get all these features in one database, step by step? The output should include these features: (vessel generic features: beam, GT, length, max_draft, vesseltype; temporal features: Expected VTT; Berth operational features: ATA_inport, ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, vessel_delay; Waterway features: tidal level; Prediction target: Actual VTT). ATA_TIME and ETD_TIME are also needed for the next step.
Response: To get all these features in one database, you can follow these steps:
```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import timedelta

# Step 1 - Load vessel generic feature data into a DataFrame
 df_gen = pd.read_csv('vesselgenericfeatures.csv')

 Step 2 - Load temporal features from inport\_count, ata\_tidal\_final and all\_shipdata\_final CSV files into separate DataFrames
 df_inport = pd.read_csv('inport_count.csv', parse_dates=['ATA_TIME'])
 df_tide = pd.read_csv('ata_tidal_final.csv')
 df_ships = pd.read_csv('all_shipdata_final.csv')

 Step 3 - Merge the three DataFrames on their common column (ATA\_TIME) using a left join to include all records from both tables in the final result, even if there is no corresponding record in one of the other tables
 merged_data = pd.merge(df_inport, df_tide, how='left', on=['ATA_TIME'])
 merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, df_ships, how='left', on=['ATA_TIME'])

 Step 4 - Extract the vessel generic features (beam, GT, length, max\_draft, and vesseltype) from df\_gen into a new pandas Series called 'vessel\_features'
 vessel_features = merged_data[df_gen.columns]

 Step 5 - Extract the temporal features ('Expected VTT', 'Berth operational features': ATA\_inport, EDT\_berth\_delay, and Vessel\_Delay) from merged\_data into separate pandas DataFrames, one for each feature type
 df_expected_vtt = merged_data[df_gen.columns + ['Expected VTT']]
 df_ata_inport = merged_data[df_gen.columns + ['ATA_INPORT']]
 df_edt_berth_delay = merged_data[df_gen.columns + ['EDT\_BERTH\_DELAY']]
 df_vessel_delay = merged_data[df_gen.columns + ['VESSEL\_DELAY']]

 Step 6 - Extract the waterway features ('Tidal Level') from df\_tide into a new pandas Series
 tidal_levels = pd.read_csv('ata_tidal_final.csv', parse_dates=['ATA_TIME'])

 Step 7 - Merge the temporal and berth operational feature dataframes on their common column (Expected VTT) using an inner join to include only records where there is a corresponding record in both tables for that value of Expected VTT. Let's call this merged DataFrame 'merged\_data'.
 merged_data = pd.merge(df_expected_vtt, df_ata_inport, how='inner', on=['Expected VTT'])
 merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, df_edt_berth_delay, how='inner', on=['EDT\_BERTH\_DELAY'])
 merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, df_vessel_delay, how='inner', on=['VESSEL\_DELAY'])

 Step 8 - Extract the vessel generic features (beam, GT, length, max\_draft, and vesseltype) from merged\_data into a new pandas Series called 'vessel\_features'
 vessel_features = merged_data[df_gen.columns]
```
Prompt: this line of code (merged_data = pd.merge(df_inport, df_tide, how='left', on=['ATA_TIME'])) throws this error: ValueError: You are trying to merge on datetime64[ns] and object columns for key 'ATA_TIME'. If you wish to proceed you should use pd.concat. How should we solve it
Response: The error is occurring because the `pd.merge` function cannot perform a left join between two dataframes where one of them has datetime64[ns] columns and the other has object columns as keys for merging on `'ATA_TIME'`. To fix this, you can use the `pd.concat` function to concatenate both dataframes along their common column (`'ATA_TIME'`), then merge the resulting dataframe with itself using an inner join.
```python
merged_data = pd.merge(df_inport, df_tide, how='left', on=['ATA_TIME'])
merged_data = pd.concat([merged_data[df_gen.columns], merged_data])
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, merged_data, how='inner')
```
Prompt: the same error persists for the first line, 
merged_data = pd.merge(df_inport, df_tide, how='left', on=['ATA_TIME'])
