﻿﻿﻿﻿Hey. I have read a paper with the following abstract:


<start abstract>

Uncertainty in vessel turnaround time (VTT) is troublesome and would reduce the operational efficiency in port management, potentially causing economic losses. Despite vessels generally providing their estimated departure time (EDT), there is frequently a considerable difference between the EDT and the actual departure time (ADT) of vessels due to various factors such as unexpected port handling inefficiency. This variability complicates the coordination of efficient port operations. Our research aims to address this issue by employing an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to predict the VTT, using vessel arrival and departure data at the Hong Kong Port for the year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. The proposed machine learning approach can provide more accurate predictions on VTT on average compared to the EDT data reported by vessels themselves, with a substantial reduction in both mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 23% (from 5.1 h to 3.9 h) and 24% (from 8.0 h to 6.1 h), respectively. These results present a significant leap forward in the predictive capabilities for the VTT and lay the foundation for further research into improving vessel scheduling efficiency, reducing port congestion and enhancing overall port performance.

I have done steps 1 and 2. About step 3, preprocessing the data, the paper writes down this:

<start of description of pre-processing>
3.2. Dataset description

The Hong Kong Marine Department updates the arrival and depar- ture information for ocean-going vessels daily on its website (Hong Kong Marine Department, 2022) that is publicly accessible. The website contains five files: vessels arrived in the last 36 h, vessels due to arrive in the next 36 h, in port vessels, vessels departed in the last 36 h and vessels intending to depart the HKP in the next 36 h. The available data, their explanations and the frequency of data updating are shown in Tables 1 and 2. For the subsequent quantitative analysis and prediction of VTT, we have collected all related data from January 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 for our analysis. The ATA, EDT and ADT datasets contain 28,126, 18,365 and 19,430 records, respectively. As indicated in the data description above, the ATA, EDT and ADT data records reported by a vessel are stored in different files. The expected VTT for a port call is the difference between the EDT and ATA for that particular voyage, while the actual VTT is the difference between the ADT and ATA. Therefore, in order to quantify the specific duration of the VTT, further data pre-processing is required.

3.3. Data collecting and pre-processing

Since the calculation of both the actual and expected VTT involves the ATA, we utilize the ATA data as the reference during the data matching process. That is, we assign the corresponding ADT and EDT data to each ATA record. The basic steps for data pre-processing in VTT analysis are as follows: (1) Obtain ATA, EDT and ADT data: Hong Kong Marine Department uploads five files containing the arrival and departure information of ocean-going vessels on the government website on a daily basis (Hong Kong Marine Department, 2022). To pair a vessels’ ATA with ADT data, as well as ATA with EDT for further analysis, the first step is to gather these ATA, EDT and ADT data from separate folders. (2) Unify the time format in the datasets: The time formats in different datasets may vary. The time for- mats for ATA, EDT, ADT and upload time are standardized to ‘‘Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second’’. All records with miss- ing time information are removed from the dataset. (3) Delete records with an ATA later than its upload time: As the system records and uploads a vessel’s ATA after it arrives at the HKP, the upload time of the ATA data will always be later than the ATA itself. If the ATA is earlier than the upload time, it can be considered inaccurate caused by system recording errors. Utilizing such erroneous ATA data as the ground truth value could adversely affect the subsequent vessel arrival analyses and predictions. Therefore, such data are removed from the ATA dataset.(4) Drop duplicated data from the datasets: The port system consistently updates vessel arrival and departure data on a daily basis, ensuring coverage for the upcoming 36 h. For each ship arrival and departure, the corresponding records of ATA, EDT and ADT are created. However, after merg- ing the data, we noticed that a single ship’s arrival might cor- respond to multiple reported ATA, EDT, or ADT records, each with a different upload time.2 For these duplicate records, we only retain the first record of ATA and ADT data and delete the subsequent ones. Regarding the EDT data, when we en- counter multiple EDT data records reported by the same vessel, we choose to keep all unique EDT records. These records are valuable as they reflect changes in the ship’s departure schedule, providing critical information for our predictive analyses. How- ever, if an EDT record remains consistent across multiple reports and only the upload time of EDT data changes, we eliminate the duplicates, keeping only the initial instance of the duplicated EDT. This approach is based on our assessment that the upload time of the EDT does not affect in our prediction models, and keeping duplicates would just make our training dataset bigger without helping our models. (5) Match the ATA and ADT data of each vessel in chronological order: During a voyage, a vessel’s ADT is always later than its ATA. To match a vessel’s ATA and ADT data, we first filter the relevant ATA and ADT data for each ship based on the call sign from the datasets. Next, we sort a vessel’s ATA records in chronological order. For each ATA record, if the ATA precedes the ADT and the time difference between them is less than 3 days,3 we consider them as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching. (6) Match the ATA and EDT data of each vessel in chronological order: This step is similar to the previous ADT matching step. We first use call sign to sort the ATA data and ADT data for the targeted vessel, but what we compare in the next step are the ATA data and the upload time of the EDT data. Specifically, for each ATA record, if the upload time of the EDT data plus one day is earlier than the ATA data and the time difference between the upload time of the EDT and ATA data is less than 5 days,4 we considerthem as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching. (7) Delete ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT Upon completing the pairing process, any ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT are considered erroneous and are deleted. This circumstance might occur because either the system records the vessel’s ATA but fails to record the corre- sponding EDT or ADT, or the vessel remains docked at the port and thus does don the corresponding ADT and EDT data. The number of ATA, EDT and ADT records before and after matching is summarized in Table 3.
<end of description of pre-processing>

Can you guide me through this preprocessing as done in the paper, step by step?
ChatGPT
Sure, let's break down the preprocessing steps outlined in the paper into actionable tasks. This will help you prepare your dataset similarly for the analysis of vessel turnaround time (VTT) at the Hong Kong Port. Assume you have the raw data collected as described.

Step 1: Obtain ATA, EDT, and ADT Data
Action: Collect data from the specified sources. You should have three datasets representing ATA (Actual Time of Arrival), EDT (Estimated Departure Time), and ADT (Actual Departure Time) of vessels. Ensure these datasets are accessible for processing, likely stored in separate folders or files as mentioned.
Step 2: Unify Time Format
Action: Standardize the time format across all datasets to "Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second". This step might require parsing and converting the time data in each record.
Tools: Python's pandas and datetime libraries are efficient for this task, allowing you to convert time formats easily.
Step 3: Delete Records with ATA Earlier than Upload Time
Action: Remove any records where the ATA is earlier than its upload time. These records are considered inaccurate due to system recording errors.
Logic: You might use conditional filtering to identify and remove these records. This ensures the data used for prediction is reliable.
Step 4: Drop Duplicated Data
Action:
For ATA and ADT data: Keep the first record and delete subsequent duplicates.
For EDT data: Keep all unique EDT records but remove duplicates where only the upload time changes.
Logic: This step involves identifying duplicates based on vessel identifiers and timestamps, then retaining or removing records according to the rules provided.
Step 5: Match ATA and ADT Data
Action: Pair ATA and ADT records for each vessel based on chronological order and a time difference of less than 3 days. Remove paired records from the dataset for subsequent rounds of matching.
Tools: This might involve sorting records, filtering based on the time difference criteria, and using vessel call signs as a key for pairing.
Step 6: Match ATA and EDT Data
Action: Similarly, pair ATA and EDT records considering the upload time of the EDT data. The pairing criteria involve a time difference of less than 5 days, with the upload time of the EDT plus one day being earlier than the ATA.
Logic: The approach is similar to Step 5 but adjusted for the specifics of matching EDT records.
Step 7: Delete ATA Records Without Corresponding ADT and EDT
Action: Remove any ATA records that do not have a corresponding ADT and EDT after the pairing process. This step cleanses the dataset of any unmatchable or irrelevant records.
Implementing the Preprocessing Steps
Implementing these steps requires careful data handling and programming skills, particularly in data manipulation and time-series analysis. Python, with its pandas library, is particularly suited for this task due to its powerful data processing capabilities.

If you need help with specific code to implement any of these steps, let me know, and I can guide you through the coding process!

﻿﻿alright! Let's start with 1. Unify time format: Ensure that all datasets have a consistent time format (e.g., 'Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second'). Remove records with missing time information.

Can you write me code that does this, given the datasets that I described earlier? The files should be saved with "_step2" added to their original filenames.
ChatGPT
Certainly! To unify the time format and remove records with missing time information, you'll need to:

Load each CSV file.
Convert the time columns (UPLOAD_TIME, ATA_TIME, ATD_TIME, and ETD_TIME) to a uniform format: Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second.
Remove records where any of these time columns have missing values.
Save the cleaned datasets with "_step2" appended to their original filenames.
Let's write the Python code to perform these steps using the pandas library. This example assumes you have pandas installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip install pandas.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Function to clean and standardize the time format of a dataset
def clean_and_standardize_time(file_path, time_columns):
    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    
    # Convert time columns to uniform format
    for column in time_columns:
        df[column] = pd.to_datetime(df[column], errors='coerce', format='%Y/%m/%d %H:%M').dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    
    # Remove rows with missing time information in specified columns
    df.dropna(subset=time_columns, inplace=True)
    
    # Return the cleaned dataframe
    return df

# File paths
ata_file = '/path/to/ATA.csv'
atd_file = '/path/to/ATD.csv'
etd_file = '/path/to/ETD.csv'

# Cleaning ATA.csv
ata_columns = ['UPLOAD_TIME', 'ATA_TIME']
ata_cleaned = clean_and_standardize_time(ata_file, ata_columns)
ata_cleaned.to_csv(ata_file.replace('.csv', '_step2.csv'), index=False)

# Cleaning ATD.csv
atd_columns = ['UPLOAD_TIME', 'ATD_TIME']
atd_cleaned = clean_and_standardize_time(atd_file, atd_columns)
atd_cleaned.to_csv(atd_file.replace('.csv', '_step2.csv'), index=False)

# Cleaning ETD.csv
etd_columns = ['UPLOAD_TIME', 'ETD_TIME']
etd_cleaned = clean_and_standardize_time(etd_file, etd_columns)
etd_cleaned.to_csv(etd_file.replace('.csv', '_step2.csv'), index=False)
Make sure to replace '/path/to/ATA.csv', '/path/to/ATD.csv', and '/path/to/ETD.csv' with the actual paths to your files. This code does the following for each file:

Loads the data.
Converts the specified time columns to the desired format, using coerce in pd.to_datetime to handle and convert invalid parsing as NaT, which are then removed by dropna().
Saves the cleaned data back to a new file with "_step2" appended to the filename.
After running this code, you should have three new files (ATA_step2.csv, ATD_step2.csv, and ETD_step2.csv) with standardized time formats and without any missing time information.

Great. everything worked. Let's go on to step 3 in pre-processing: Delete records with an ATA later than its upload time. 

I have the following data CSV file:
ATA_step2.csv, it has columns (I have included some sample rows): 
VESSEL_NAME	CALL_SIGN	VESSEL_MAX_DRAFT	ATA_TIME	BERTH	AGENT_NAME	UPLOAD_TIME	FLAG	LAST_PORT

Can you write me some code that does this? The file should be saved with "_3" added to the filename from the last step
ChatGPT
Certainly! To proceed with deleting records where the Actual Time of Arrival (ATA) is later than its upload time, we'll follow these steps:

Load the CSV file.
Convert ATA_TIME and UPLOAD_TIME to datetime format to ensure they are comparable.
Filter out rows where ATA_TIME is later than UPLOAD_TIME.
Save the cleaned data with "_3" appended to the original filename.
Here's the Python code to perform these operations:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
ata_file_step2 = '/path/to/ATA_step2.csv'  # Adjust the file path
df_ata = pd.read_csv(ata_file_step2)

# Convert 'ATA_TIME' and 'UPLOAD_TIME' to datetime
df_ata['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(df_ata['ATA_TIME'])
df_ata['UPLOAD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(df_ata['UPLOAD_TIME'])

# Filter out rows where 'ATA_TIME' is later than 'UPLOAD_TIME'
df_filtered = df_ata[df_ata['ATA_TIME'] <= df_ata['UPLOAD_TIME']]

# Save the cleaned data
output_file = ata_file_step2.replace('_step2.csv', '_step3.csv')
df_filtered.to_csv(output_file, index=False)

print(f"Data cleaned and saved to {output_file}")
Before running this code, please make sure to update the ata_file_step2 variable with the correct path to your ATA_step2.csv file. This code will produce a new file, ATA_step3.csv, which excludes any records violating the ATA and upload time condition you described.

User
That worked! Now let's continue with step 4. According to the paper: "(4) Drop duplicated data from the datasets: The port system consistently updates vessel arrival and departure data on a daily basis, ensuring coverage for the upcoming 36 h. For each ship arrival and departure, the corresponding records of ATA, EDT and ADT are created. However, after merg- ing the data, we noticed that a single ship’s arrival might correspond to multiple reported ATA, EDT, or ADT records, each with a different upload time. For these duplicate records, we only retain the first record of ATA and ADT data and delete the subsequent ones. Regarding the EDT data, when we en- counter multiple EDT data records reported by the same vessel, we choose to keep all unique EDT records. These records are valuable as they reflect changes in the ship’s departure schedule, providing critical information for our predictive analyses. However, if an EDT record remains consistent across multiple reports and only the upload time of EDT data changes, we eliminate the duplicates, keeping only the initial instance of the duplicated EDT. This approach is based on our assessment that the upload time of the EDT does not affect in our prediction models, and keeping duplicates would just make our training dataset bigger without helping our models."

Can you write me some code that does this?

To address step 4 of the preprocessing as described in the paper, we'll perform the following operations for each dataset:

ATA_step3.csv and ADT_step2.csv: Drop duplicates based on CALL_SIGN and ATA_TIME or ATD_TIME, respectively, keeping only the first occurrence.
EDT_step2.csv: Drop duplicates based on CALL_SIGN and ETD_TIME, but with a nuance. We keep all unique EDT records for the same vessel (identified by CALL_SIGN), except when the only difference is the UPLOAD_TIME; in such cases, we keep only the first record.
Here's how you can implement this in Python:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

def drop_duplicates_ata_adt(file_path, unique_columns, output_suffix):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    df.drop_duplicates(subset=unique_columns, keep='first', inplace=True)
    output_file = file_path.replace('.csv', f'_{output_suffix}.csv')
    df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
    return output_file

def drop_duplicates_edt(file_path, output_suffix):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    # Sort by UPLOAD_TIME to keep the earliest record in case of duplicates
    df.sort_values(by=['CALL_SIGN', 'ETD_TIME', 'UPLOAD_TIME'], inplace=True)
    # Drop duplicates based on CALL_SIGN and ETD_TIME, keeping the first (earliest UPLOAD_TIME)
    df.drop_duplicates(subset=['CALL_SIGN', 'ETD_TIME'], keep='first', inplace=True)
    output_file = file_path.replace('.csv', f'_{output_suffix}.csv')
    df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
    return output_file

# Apply the functions
ata_cleaned_file = drop_duplicates_ata_adt('/path/to/ATA_step3.csv', ['CALL_SIGN', 'ATA_TIME'], 'step4')
adt_cleaned_file = drop_duplicates_ata_adt('/path/to/ADT_step2.csv', ['CALL_SIGN', 'ATD_TIME'], 'step4')
edt_cleaned_file = drop_duplicates_edt('/path/to/EDT_step2.csv', 'step4')

print(f"ATA cleaned and saved to {ata_cleaned_file}")
print(f"ADT cleaned and saved to {adt_cleaned_file}")
print(f"EDT cleaned and saved to {edt_cleaned_file}")
This script:

Loads each CSV file.
Applies the specific deduplication logic for each type of dataset (ATA/ADT and EDT).
Saves the cleaned datasets with a new suffix indicating the preprocessing step.
Make sure to replace '/path/to/...' with the actual paths to your files. This code will generate new files (ATA_step3_step4.csv, ADT_step2_step4.csv, and EDT_step2_step4.csv) with duplicated records handled as per the requirements.

That was step 4. We should now continue to step 5. The paper says this about it: Match the ATA and ADT data of each vessel in chronological order: During a voyage, a vessel’s ADT is always later than its ATA. To match a vessel’s ATA and ADT data, we first filter the relevant ATA and ADT data for each ship based on the call sign from the datasets. Next, we sort a vessel’s ATA records in chronological order. For each ATA record, if the ATA precedes the ADT and the time difference between them is less than 3 days,3 we consider them as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching.

For step 5, you want to match the ATA and ADT records of each vessel, ensuring the ADT is always later than its corresponding ATA and the time difference between them is less than 3 days. This process involves filtering, sorting, and then matching based on these criteria.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
ata_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/ATA_step4.csv')
atd_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/ADT_step4.csv')

# Convert 'ATA_TIME' and 'ATD_TIME' to datetime for comparison
ata_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(ata_df['ATA_TIME'])
atd_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(atd_df['ATD_TIME'])

# Initialize an empty DataFrame to store matched records
matched_records = pd.DataFrame()

# Loop through each unique vessel's CALL_SIGN in the ATA dataset
for call_sign in ata_df['CALL_SIGN'].unique():
    # Filter ATA and ADT records for the current vessel
    ata_records = ata_df[ata_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATA_TIME')
    atd_records = atd_df[atd_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATD_TIME')
    
    # Loop through each ATA record to find a matching ADT record
    for _, ata_row in ata_records.iterrows():
        # Find the first ADT record that is later than the ATA record and within 3 days
        match = atd_records[(atd_records['ATD_TIME'] > ata_row['ATA_TIME']) & 
                            ((atd_records['ATD_TIME'] - ata_row['ATA_TIME']) <= pd.Timedelta(days=3))].head(1)
        if not match.empty:
            # Combine ATA and matched ADT record
            combined_row = pd.concat([ata_row, match.iloc[0]], axis=0)
            matched_records = matched_records.append(combined_row, ignore_index=True)
            
            # Remove the matched ADT record to prevent it from being matched again
            atd_records = atd_records.drop(match.index)

# Save the matched records to a new CSV file
matched_records.to_csv('/path/to/matched_ATA_ADT.csv', index=False)
This script does the following:

Loads the ATA and ADT datasets.
Converts the ATA_TIME and ATD_TIME columns to datetime objects for accurate comparison.
Iterates through each vessel's CALL_SIGN to filter their ATA and ADT records.
For each ATA record, it finds the first ADT record that occurs within 3 days after the ATA but not before, indicating a valid pairing according to the paper's criteria.
Combines the matched ATA and ADT records into a new dataframe.
Saves the matched records into a CSV file for further processing.
Remember to replace '/path/to/...' with the actual paths to your CSV files. The output will be a new CSV file containing matched ATA and ADT records for further analysis as per your study's requirements.

The error you're encountering suggests that there's an issue with the append method on a DataFrame object, which is unexpected because pandas.DataFrame does indeed have an append method. The error message seems unusual, as append is a standard method for concatenating rows in a DataFrame.

Let's try a slightly modified approach using concat instead of append for adding rows to the matched_records DataFrame. This method is typically more efficient for concatenating multiple DataFrames or Series, especially in a loop.

Here's an updated version of the code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
ata_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/ATA_step4.csv')
atd_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/ADT_step4.csv')

# Convert 'ATA_TIME' and 'ATD_TIME' to datetime for comparison
ata_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(ata_df['ATA_TIME'])
atd_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(atd_df['ATD_TIME'])

# Initialize a list to store matched records
matched_records_list = []

# Loop through each unique vessel's CALL_SIGN in the ATA dataset
for call_sign in ata_df['CALL_SIGN'].unique():
    # Filter ATA and ADT records for the current vessel
    ata_records = ata_df[ata_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATA_TIME')
    atd_records = atd_df[atd_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATD_TIME')
    
    # Loop through each ATA record to find a matching ADT record
    for _, ata_row in ata_records.iterrows():
        # Find the first ADT record that is later than the ATA record and within 3 days
        match = atd_records[(atd_records['ATD_TIME'] > ata_row['ATA_TIME']) & 
                            ((atd_records['ATD_TIME'] - ata_row['ATA_TIME']) <= pd.Timedelta(days=3))].head(1)
        if not match.empty:
            # Combine ATA and matched ADT record
            combined_row = pd.concat([ata_row, match.iloc[0]], axis=1).T
            matched_records_list.append(combined_row)
            
            # Remove the matched ADT record to prevent it from being matched again
            atd_records = atd_records.drop(match.index)

# Concatenate all matched records into a DataFrame
matched_records = pd.concat(matched_records_list, ignore_index=True)

# Save the matched records to a new CSV file
matched_records.to_csv('/path/to/matched_ATA_ADT.csv', index=False)
This revision uses a list to collect each matched record as a DataFrame and then concatenates all those DataFrames together outside of the loop. This should avoid the error you encountered and might also run a bit more efficiently.

Please make sure the file paths ('/path/to/ATA_step4.csv', '/path/to/ADT_step4.csv', and the output file path) are correctly replaced with your actual file paths.

The output format you're seeing is caused by the concatenation of two DataFrames (for ATA and ADT records) along the columns without properly aligning them. This results in two sets of indices being joined side by side.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the columns are correctly matched and aligned when we combine the rows. We'll adjust the code to merge the DataFrames on the common columns, then drop any unnecessary duplicate columns that might result from this operation.

Here is the revised code that should output the data in the correct format:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
ata_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/ATA_step4.csv')
atd_df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/ADT_step4.csv')

# Convert 'ATA_TIME' and 'ATD_TIME' to datetime for comparison
ata_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(ata_df['ATA_TIME'])
atd_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(atd_df['ATD_TIME'])

# Initialize a list to store matched records
matched_records_list = []

# Loop through each unique vessel's CALL_SIGN in the ATA dataset
for call_sign in ata_df['CALL_SIGN'].unique():
    # Filter ATA and ADT records for the current vessel
    ata_records = ata_df[ata_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATA_TIME')
    atd_records = atd_df[atd_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATD_TIME')
    
    # Loop through each ATA record to find a matching ADT record
    for ata_index, ata_row in ata_records.iterrows():
        # Find the first ADT record that is later than the ATA record and within 3 days
        match = atd_records[(atd_records['ATD_TIME'] > ata_row['ATA_TIME']) & 
                            ((atd_records['ATD_TIME'] - ata_row['ATA_TIME']) <= pd.Timedelta(days=3))]
        if not match.empty:
            atd_index = match.index[0]
            # Merge the matched records into a single series
            combined_row = ata_row.append(atd_df.loc[atd_index])
            matched_records_list.append(combined_row)
            
            # Remove the matched ADT record to prevent it from being matched again
            atd_records = atd_records.drop(atd_index)

# Concatenate all matched records into a DataFrame
matched_records = pd.concat(matched_records_list, axis=1).T.reset_index(drop=True)

# Save the matched records to a new CSV file
matched_records.to_csv('/path/to/matched_ATA_ADT.csv', index=False)
Make sure the file paths are correct before running the script. The output should now have the matched records in the correct format without the misaligned columns. The use of T (transpose) ensures the combined rows from the list of Series are appended as rows in the final DataFrame.

Please adjust the paths to your ATA and ADT files and run the revised code. It should yield a CSV file with the correct formatting for the matched ATA and ADT records.

I apologize for the confusion. The error suggests that there is an issue with the use of append on a Pandas Series. The append function should normally work on a Series, so this error is unusual. It may be a version-related issue or an anomaly with the specific environment setup.

Let's try a different approach using the concat function, which is generally the recommended method for combining Series into a DataFrame in Pandas:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
ata_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ATA_step4.csv')
atd_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ADT_step4.csv')

# Convert 'ATA_TIME' and 'ATD_TIME' to datetime for comparison
ata_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(ata_df['ATA_TIME'])
atd_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(atd_df['ATD_TIME'])

# Initialize an empty DataFrame to store matched records
matched_records = pd.DataFrame()

# Loop through each unique vessel's CALL_SIGN in the ATA dataset
for call_sign in ata_df['CALL_SIGN'].unique():
    # Filter ATA and ADT records for the current vessel
    ata_records = ata_df[ata_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATA_TIME')
    atd_records = atd_df[atd_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATD_TIME')
    
    # Loop through each ATA record to find a matching ADT record
    for _, ata_row in ata_records.iterrows():
        # Find the first ADT record that is later than the ATA record and within 3 days
        match = atd_records[(atd_records['ATD_TIME'] > ata_row['ATA_TIME']) & 
                            ((atd_records['ATD_TIME'] - ata_row['ATA_TIME']) <= pd.Timedelta(days=3))]
        if not match.empty:
            # Combine ATA and matched ADT record
            matched_atd = match.iloc[0]
            combined_row = pd.concat([ata_row, matched_atd])
            matched_records = matched_records.append(combined_row, ignore_index=True)
            
            # Remove the matched ADT record to prevent it from being matched again
            atd_records.drop(match.index, inplace=True)

# Save the matched records to a new CSV file
matched_records.to_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ADT.csv', index=False)
In this code, we concatenate each ata_row with its matching matched_atd into a single Series object and then append that combined Series to matched_records DataFrame. After running this script, the resulting matched_ATA_ADT.csv should have the correctly matched and formatted ATA and ADT records.

Please try this script and check the output file.

I see the issue persists; let's try another approach. Since appending is causing issues, we'll use concat directly on a list of Series to build our DataFrame.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
ata_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ATA_step4.csv')
atd_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ADT_step4.csv')

# Convert 'ATA_TIME' and 'ATD_TIME' to datetime for comparison
ata_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(ata_df['ATA_TIME'])
atd_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(atd_df['ATD_TIME'])

# Initialize a list to store matched records as Series
matched_records_series = []

# Loop through each unique vessel's CALL_SIGN in the ATA dataset
for call_sign in ata_df['CALL_SIGN'].unique():
    # Filter ATA and ADT records for the current vessel
    ata_records = ata_df[ata_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATA_TIME')
    atd_records = atd_df[atd_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATD_TIME')
    
    # Loop through each ATA record to find a matching ADT record
    for _, ata_row in ata_records.iterrows():
        # Find the first ADT record that is later than the ATA record and within 3 days
        match = atd_records[(atd_records['ATD_TIME'] > ata_row['ATA_TIME']) & 
                            ((atd_records['ATD_TIME'] - ata_row['ATA_TIME']) <= pd.Timedelta(days=3))]
        if not match.empty:
            matched_atd = match.iloc[0]
            # Combine ATA and matched ADT record into a single Series
            combined_series = ata_row.append(matched_atd)
            matched_records_series.append(combined_series)
            
            # Remove the matched ADT record to prevent it from being matched again
            atd_records = atd_records.drop(match.index)

# Concatenate all matched record Series into a DataFrame
matched_records_df = pd.concat(matched_records_series, axis=1).T.reset_index(drop=True)

# Save the matched records to a new CSV file
matched_records_df.to_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ADT.csv', index=False)
This code creates a list of Series objects, matched_records_series, each representing a combined row of matched ATA and ADT records. Once all matches are made, we concatenate this list of Series into a DataFrame with pd.concat(matched_records_series, axis=1).T. The transpose (.T) is necessary because pd.concat concatenates Series objects as columns by default, and we need them as rows.

Please run this script and verify the output file matched_ATA_ADT.csv to ensure the data is correctly formatted.

this error now is thrown:

It appears there's a persistent issue with the append method which should not be happening as it's a standard Pandas operation. This might indicate an issue with the specific Pandas environment. Normally, in an up-to-date and healthy Pandas environment, both DataFrame.append() and Series.append() are valid and commonly used methods.

Given the trouble with append, let's completely bypass that method and build our dataframe directly through list manipulations and then convert it to a DataFrame. This should avoid any potential method conflicts.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
ata_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ATA_step4.csv')
atd_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ADT_step4.csv')

# Convert 'ATA_TIME' and 'ATD_TIME' to datetime for comparison
ata_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(ata_df['ATA_TIME'])
atd_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(atd_df['ATD_TIME'])

# Initialize a list to store the matched records
matched_records_list = []

# Loop through each unique vessel's CALL_SIGN in the ATA dataset
for call_sign in ata_df['CALL_SIGN'].unique():
    # Filter ATA and ADT records for the current vessel
    ata_records = ata_df[ata_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATA_TIME')
    atd_records = atd_df[atd_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATD_TIME')
    
    # Loop through each ATA record to find a matching ADT record
    for _, ata_row in ata_records.iterrows():
        # Find the first ADT record that is later than the ATA record and within 3 days
        match = atd_records[(atd_records['ATD_TIME'] > ata_row['ATA_TIME']) & 
                            ((atd_records['ATD_TIME'] - ata_row['ATA_TIME']) <= pd.Timedelta(days=3))]
        if not match.empty:
            matched_atd = match.iloc[0]
            # Combine the data into a dictionary
            combined_data = {**ata_row.to_dict(), **matched_atd.to_dict()}
            matched_records_list.append(combined_data)
            
            # Remove the matched ADT record to prevent it from being matched again
            atd_records = atd_records.drop(match.index)

# Create a DataFrame from the list of dictionaries
matched_records_df = pd.DataFrame(matched_records_list)

# Save the matched records to a new CSV file
matched_records_df.to_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ADT.csv', index=False)
This code uses dictionary unpacking to merge the information from the ata_row and matched_atd records, effectively bypassing the need to use the append method. After running the script, you should have a correctly formatted DataFrame containing your matched data, which is then saved to a CSV file.

Try this version and check the resulting CSV for the correct data format.

Great, it worked! That was step 5. We should now continue to step 6. The paper says this about it: Match the ATA and ETD data of each vessel in chronological order: This step is similar to the previous ADT matching step. We first use call sign to sort the ATA data and ETD data for the targeted vessel, but what we compare in the next step are the ATA time and the upload time of the ETD data. Specifically, for each ATA record, if the upload time of the ETD data plus one day is later than the ATA data and the time difference between the upload time of the ETD and ATA data is less than 5 days we consider them as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching.

I have these CSVs:
ATA_step4.csv, it has columns (I have included some sample rows): 
VESSEL_NAME	CALL_SIGN	VESSEL_MAX_DRAFT	ATA_TIME	BERTH	AGENT_NAME	UPLOAD_TIME	FLAG	LAST_PORT

Can you write me some code that does this? All data available in both CSVs should be put concatenated in the final file with matched pairs.

Certainly, we'll follow a procedure similar to step 5 to match the ATA and ETD records. For each ATA record, we'll look for the corresponding ETD records and pair them based on the conditions given:

The upload time of the ETD data plus one day is later than the ATA data.
The time difference between the upload time of the ETD and ATA data is less than 5 days.
We'll then create a new DataFrame for the matched pairs. Here's the code to do that:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
ata_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ATA_step4.csv')
etd_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ETD_step4.csv')

ata_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(ata_df['ATA_TIME'])
etd_df['UPLOAD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(etd_df['UPLOAD_TIME'])
etd_df['ETD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(etd_df['ETD_TIME'])  # Assuming you want to keep the ETD_TIME as well

# Initialize a list to store the matched records
matched_records_list = []

# Loop through each unique vessel's CALL_SIGN in the ATA dataset
for call_sign in ata_df['CALL_SIGN'].unique():
    # Filter ATA and ETD records for the current vessel
    ata_records = ata_df[ata_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='ATA_TIME')
    etd_records = etd_df[etd_df['CALL_SIGN'] == call_sign].sort_values(by='UPLOAD_TIME')
    
    # Loop through each ATA record to find a matching ETD record
    for _, ata_row in ata_records.iterrows():
        # Find the ETD records where the upload time of the ETD data plus one day is later than the ATA data
        # and the time difference between the upload time of the ETD and ATA data is less than 5 days
        matches = etd_records[
            (etd_records['UPLOAD_TIME'] + pd.Timedelta(days=1) > ata_row['ATA_TIME']) & 
            ((etd_records['UPLOAD_TIME'] - ata_row['ATA_TIME']) < pd.Timedelta(days=5))
        ]
        for _, etd_row in matches.iterrows():
            # Combine the data into a dictionary and append to the list
            combined_data = {**ata_row.to_dict(), **etd_row.to_dict()}
            matched_records_list.append(combined_data)
            # Assuming each ATA can match multiple ETDs, we don't remove matched ETD records here

# Create a DataFrame from the list of dictionaries
matched_records_df = pd.DataFrame(matched_records_list)

# Save the matched records to a new CSV file
matched_records_df.to_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ETD.csv', index=False)
This code will give you a DataFrame matched_records_df that contains all the information from both the ATA and ETD files, with the matched pairs based on the criteria mentioned in step 6.

Before running this script, please ensure that the file paths are correctly specified. After execution, you'll have a CSV file /mnt/data/matched_ATA_ETD.csv containing the matched data.

That was step 6. We should now continue to step 7. The paper says this about it: Delete ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT Upon completing the pairing process, any ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT are considered erroneous and are deleted. This circumstance might occur because either thesystem records the vessel’s ATA but fails to record the corresponding EDT or ADT, or the vessel remains docked at the port and thus does don the corresponding ADT and EDT data.

I now have these CSVs:

Can you write me some code that merges these CSVs based on unique ATA - callsign records? Rows without either ATD or ETD data should be removed.
ChatGPT
To merge matched_ATA_ADT.csv and matched_ATA_ETD.csv based on unique ATA records and CALL_SIGN, and then remove rows without either ATD or ETD data, you can follow these steps in Python using the pandas library:

Load both CSV files into DataFrames.
Merge the DataFrames on common columns (CALL_SIGN, VESSEL_NAME, ATA_TIME, etc.).
Drop rows where both ATD_TIME and ETD_TIME are missing since we want to remove records without either ATD or ETD data.
Save the merged and cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file.
Here's the Python code that accomplishes this:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
matched_ata_adt_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ADT.csv')
matched_ata_etd_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ETD.csv')

# Convert 'ATA_TIME' to datetime for accurate merging
matched_ata_adt_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_adt_df['ATA_TIME'])
matched_ata_etd_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_etd_df['ATA_TIME'])

# Merge the two DataFrames on common columns
common_columns = list(set(matched_ata_adt_df.columns).intersection(set(matched_ata_etd_df.columns)))
merged_df = pd.merge(matched_ata_adt_df, matched_ata_etd_df, on=common_columns, how='outer')

# Drop rows where both 'ATD_TIME' and 'ETD_TIME' are missing
merged_df.dropna(subset=['ATD_TIME', 'ETD_TIME'], how='all', inplace=True)

# Save the merged and cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file
merged_df.to_csv('/mnt/data/merged_ATA.csv', index=False)
This script should result in a new CSV file, /mnt/data/merged_ATA.csv, that contains the combined data from the matched ATA-ADT and ATA-ETD records, excluding rows where both ATD and ETD data are missing.

Before running the script, please ensure that the file paths are correctly specified. After execution, verify the contents of merged_ATA.csv to ensure it meets the requirements.

rows with an empty ETD or ATD are not removed. I have included some sample rows of the output.

It appears there was an issue with filtering the merged DataFrame. We need to make sure that rows with missing ATD_TIME or ETD_TIME are properly identified and removed. In your sample output, the missing values are indicated as "NaN" (not a number), which is the standard missing value marker used in pandas.

Here's the correct approach to filter out those rows:

Check for missing ATD_TIME or ETD_TIME after the merge.
Remove rows where either of these columns is NaN.
Let's adjust the code to make sure it filters out these rows correctly:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
matched_ata_adt_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ADT.csv')
matched_ata_etd_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ETD.csv')

# Merge the two DataFrames on common columns
common_columns = list(set(matched_ata_adt_df.columns).intersection(set(matched_ata_etd_df.columns)))
merged_df = pd.merge(matched_ata_adt_df, matched_ata_etd_df, on=common_columns, how='outer')

# Replace 'NAN' string with actual NaN value if necessary
merged_df.replace('NAN', pd.NA, inplace=True)

# Ensure that ATD_TIME and ETD_TIME are in the correct datetime format or NaT
merged_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(merged_df['ATD_TIME'], errors='coerce')
merged_df['ETD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(merged_df['ETD_TIME'], errors='coerce')

# Drop rows where both 'ATD_TIME' and 'ETD_TIME' are missing
merged_df.dropna(subset=['ATD_TIME', 'ETD_TIME'], how='all', inplace=True)

# Save the merged and cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file
merged_df.to_csv('/mnt/data/merged_ATA.csv', index=False)
This code should give you a DataFrame with only the rows where there is either ATD_TIME or ETD_TIME data available. If both are missing, the row is dropped.

Run this script and check the resulting merged_ATA.csv to ensure that it has correctly filtered out rows with missing ATD and ETD times.

the same error still persists. Some ATD or ETD cells are empty. 
ChatGPT
I apologize for the inconvenience. Let's refine our approach to ensure we correctly handle rows with empty ATD or ETD values.

Load the datasets.
Merge the DataFrames on common columns, ensuring that we have a full outer join to capture all possible matches.
Check for NaN in both ATD_TIME and ETD_TIME and remove rows where both are NaN after the merge.
Save the cleaned DataFrame.
Here's the updated code to implement this:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
matched_ata_adt_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ADT.csv')
matched_ata_etd_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ETD.csv')

# Making sure we're working with proper datetime formats
matched_ata_adt_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_adt_df['ATA_TIME'])
matched_ata_adt_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_adt_df['ATD_TIME'], errors='coerce')
matched_ata_etd_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_etd_df['ATA_TIME'])
matched_ata_etd_df['ETD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_etd_df['ETD_TIME'], errors='coerce')

# Merge the two DataFrames on the 'CALL_SIGN' and 'ATA_TIME', as these are the unique identifiers
merged_df = pd.merge(matched_ata_adt_df, matched_ata_etd_df, on=['CALL_SIGN', 'ATA_TIME'], how='outer', suffixes=('_ADT', '_ETD'))

# Now we filter out rows where both ATD_TIME and ETD_TIME are NaN
# We use notna() to find rows where these columns are not NaN and then use any(axis=1) to keep the row if any of these two values is not NaN
filtered_df = merged_df[merged_df[['ATD_TIME', 'ETD_TIME']].notna().any(axis=1)]

# Save the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file
filtered_df.to_csv('/mnt/data/filtered_ATA.csv', index=False)
Please run this updated script, and it should yield a filtered_ATA.csv file that excludes rows where both ATD_TIME and ETD_TIME are NaN. This should resolve the issue with empty ATD or ETD cells.

User
Now some rows still include no ATD or ETD. please try another method. Rows that miss either of these values should be removed.

Let's attempt a more explicit approach to filter out rows where either ATD_TIME or ETD_TIME is missing:

Load both CSV files into DataFrames.
Convert any string representations of missing data into actual NaN values.
Merge the DataFrames on common columns.
Explicitly drop rows where either ATD_TIME or ETD_TIME is NaN.
Save the final DataFrame to a new CSV file.
Here's the revised code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the datasets
matched_ata_adt_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ADT.csv')
matched_ata_etd_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ETD.csv')

# Convert all 'NAN' or empty string representations to actual NaN values
matched_ata_adt_df.replace({'NAN': np.nan, '': np.nan, None: np.nan}, inplace=True)
matched_ata_etd_df.replace({'NAN': np.nan, '': np.nan, None: np.nan}, inplace=True)

# Making sure 'ATD_TIME' and 'ETD_TIME' are parsed as datetime, coerce errors to NaT (Not a Time)
matched_ata_adt_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_adt_df['ATD_TIME'], errors='coerce')
matched_ata_etd_df['ETD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_etd_df['ETD_TIME'], errors='coerce')

# Merge the two DataFrames on 'CALL_SIGN' and 'ATA_TIME', which are the identifiers
merged_df = pd.merge(matched_ata_adt_df, matched_ata_etd_df, 
                     on=['VESSEL_NAME', 'CALL_SIGN', 'VESSEL_MAX_DRAFT', 'ATA_TIME', 'BERTH', 'AGENT_NAME', 'UPLOAD_TIME', 'FLAG', 'LAST_PORT', 'NEXT_PORT'],
                     how='outer',
                     suffixes=('_ADT', '_ETD'))

# Drop rows where 'ATD_TIME' or 'ETD_TIME' is NaN
final_df = merged_df.dropna(subset=['ATD_TIME', 'ETD_TIME'], how='any')

# Save the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file
final_df.to_csv('/mnt/data/final_ATA.csv', index=False)
This script should create a file final_ATA.csv that has only the rows where both ATD_TIME and ETD_TIME are present. Please run it and check the output file to confirm that rows with missing ATD or ETD have been successfully filtered out.

User
the file now is empty. please try again
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. Let's go through the process again, step by step, to ensure we achieve the desired result:

Load both CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
Convert the time columns to the datetime type, if they are not already.
Merge the DataFrames on the 'CALL_SIGN' and 'ATA_TIME', which are the unique identifiers for each vessel's port call.
After merging, filter out rows where both 'ATD_TIME' from matched_ATA_ADT.csv and 'ETD_TIME' from matched_ATA_ETD.csv are missing.
Here's how you can do this:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
matched_ata_adt_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ADT.csv')
matched_ata_etd_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/matched_ATA_ETD.csv')

# Convert the time columns to datetime objects for accurate comparison and merging
matched_ata_adt_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_adt_df['ATA_TIME'], errors='coerce')
matched_ata_adt_df['ATD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_adt_df['ATD_TIME'], errors='coerce')
matched_ata_etd_df['ATA_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_etd_df['ATA_TIME'], errors='coerce')
matched_ata_etd_df['ETD_TIME'] = pd.to_datetime(matched_ata_etd_df['ETD_TIME'], errors='coerce')

# Merge the two DataFrames on the 'CALL_SIGN' and 'ATA_TIME'
merged_df = pd.merge(matched_ata_adt_df, matched_ata_etd_df, on=['CALL_SIGN', 'ATA_TIME'], how='outer', suffixes=('_ADT', '_ETD'))

# Filter out rows where both 'ATD_TIME' and 'ETD_TIME' are NaN
filtered_df = merged_df.dropna(subset=['ATD_TIME', 'ETD_TIME'], how='all')

# Save the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file
filtered_df.to_csv('/mnt/data/filtered_ATA.csv', index=False)
This script merges the two CSV files and keeps only the rows where there is either an ATD_TIME or an ETD_TIME available. It should produce a filtered_ATA.csv file with the correctly filtered data.

Let's run the above script and check the resulting output file.
