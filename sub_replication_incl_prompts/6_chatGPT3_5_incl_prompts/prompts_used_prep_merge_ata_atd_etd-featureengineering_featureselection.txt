﻿﻿﻿﻿Hey. I have read a paper with the following abstract:


<start abstract>

Uncertainty in vessel turnaround time (VTT) is troublesome and would reduce the operational efficiency in port management, potentially causing economic losses. Despite vessels generally providing their estimated departure time (EDT), there is frequently a considerable difference between the EDT and the actual departure time (ADT) of vessels due to various factors such as unexpected port handling inefficiency. This variability complicates the coordination of efficient port operations. Our research aims to address this issue by employing an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model to predict the VTT, using vessel arrival and departure data at the Hong Kong Port for the year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. The proposed machine learning approach can provide more accurate predictions on VTT on average compared to the EDT data reported by vessels themselves, with a substantial reduction in both mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 23% (from 5.1 h to 3.9 h) and 24% (from 8.0 h to 6.1 h), respectively. These results present a significant leap forward in the predictive capabilities for the VTT and lay the foundation for further research into improving vessel scheduling efficiency, reducing port congestion and enhancing overall port performance.

I have done steps 1 and 2. About step 3, preprocessing the data, the paper writes down this:

<start of description of pre-processing>
3.2. Dataset description

The Hong Kong Marine Department updates the arrival and depar- ture information for ocean-going vessels daily on its website (Hong Kong Marine Department, 2022) that is publicly accessible. The website contains five files: vessels arrived in the last 36 h, vessels due to arrive in the next 36 h, in port vessels, vessels departed in the last 36 h and vessels intending to depart the HKP in the next 36 h. The available data, their explanations and the frequency of data updating are shown in Tables 1 and 2. For the subsequent quantitative analysis and prediction of VTT, we have collected all related data from January 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 for our analysis. The ATA, EDT and ADT datasets contain 28,126, 18,365 and 19,430 records, respectively. As indicated in the data description above, the ATA, EDT and ADT data records reported by a vessel are stored in different files. The expected VTT for a port call is the difference between the EDT and ATA for that particular voyage, while the actual VTT is the difference between the ADT and ATA. Therefore, in order to quantify the specific duration of the VTT, further data pre-processing is required.

3.3. Data collecting and pre-processing

Since the calculation of both the actual and expected VTT involves the ATA, we utilize the ATA data as the reference during the data matching process. That is, we assign the corresponding ADT and EDT data to each ATA record. The basic steps for data pre-processing in VTT analysis are as follows: (1) Obtain ATA, EDT and ADT data: Hong Kong Marine Department uploads five files containing the arrival and departure information of ocean-going vessels on the government website on a daily basis (Hong Kong Marine Department, 2022). To pair a vessels’ ATA with ADT data, as well as ATA with EDT for further analysis, the first step is to gather these ATA, EDT and ADT data from separate folders. (2) Unify the time format in the datasets: The time formats in different datasets may vary. The time for- mats for ATA, EDT, ADT and upload time are standardized to ‘‘Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second’’. All records with miss- ing time information are removed from the dataset. (3) Delete records with an ATA later than its upload time: As the system records and uploads a vessel’s ATA after it arrives at the HKP, the upload time of the ATA data will always be later than the ATA itself. If the ATA is earlier than the upload time, it can be considered inaccurate caused by system recording errors. Utilizing such erroneous ATA data as the ground truth value could adversely affect the subsequent vessel arrival analyses and predictions. Therefore, such data are removed from the ATA dataset.(4) Drop duplicated data from the datasets: The port system consistently updates vessel arrival and departure data on a daily basis, ensuring coverage for the upcoming 36 h. For each ship arrival and departure, the corresponding records of ATA, EDT and ADT are created. However, after merg- ing the data, we noticed that a single ship’s arrival might cor- respond to multiple reported ATA, EDT, or ADT records, each with a different upload time.2 For these duplicate records, we only retain the first record of ATA and ADT data and delete the subsequent ones. Regarding the EDT data, when we en- counter multiple EDT data records reported by the same vessel, we choose to keep all unique EDT records. These records are valuable as they reflect changes in the ship’s departure schedule, providing critical information for our predictive analyses. How- ever, if an EDT record remains consistent across multiple reports and only the upload time of EDT data changes, we eliminate the duplicates, keeping only the initial instance of the duplicated EDT. This approach is based on our assessment that the upload time of the EDT does not affect in our prediction models, and keeping duplicates would just make our training dataset bigger without helping our models. (5) Match the ATA and ADT data of each vessel in chronological order: During a voyage, a vessel’s ADT is always later than its ATA. To match a vessel’s ATA and ADT data, we first filter the relevant ATA and ADT data for each ship based on the call sign from the datasets. Next, we sort a vessel’s ATA records in chronological order. For each ATA record, if the ATA precedes the ADT and the time difference between them is less than 3 days,3 we consider them as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching. (6) Match the ATA and EDT data of each vessel in chronological order: This step is similar to the previous ADT matching step. We first use call sign to sort the ATA data and ADT data for the targeted vessel, but what we compare in the next step are the ATA data and the upload time of the EDT data. Specifically, for each ATA record, if the upload time of the EDT data plus one day is earlier than the ATA data and the time difference between the upload time of the EDT and ATA data is less than 5 days,4 we considerthem as a pair. After pairing, the ATA and ADT data are removed from the dataset for the next round of matching. (7) Delete ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT Upon completing the pairing process, any ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT are considered erroneous and are deleted. This circumstance might occur because either the system records the vessel’s ATA but fails to record the corre- sponding EDT or ADT, or the vessel remains docked at the port and thus does don the corresponding ADT and EDT data. The number of ATA, EDT and ADT records before and after matching is summarized in Table 3.
<end of description of pre-processing>

Can you guide me through this preprocessing as done in the paper, step by step?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's break down the preprocessing steps mentioned in the paper and guide you through them:

Obtain ATA, EDT, and ADT data:

Retrieve the ATA, EDT, and ADT data from the separate folders provided by the Hong Kong Marine Department.
Unify the time format in the datasets:

Standardize the time formats for ATA, EDT, ADT, and upload time to 'Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second'. Remove records with missing time information.
Delete records with an ATA later than its upload time:

Filter out ATA records where the ATA time is later than the upload time, as these are considered inaccurate due to system recording errors.
Drop duplicated data from the datasets:

Remove duplicate records from the datasets.
For ATA and ADT data: Retain the first record of ATA and ADT data and delete subsequent duplicates.
For EDT data: Keep all unique EDT records. If multiple EDT records exist for the same vessel, retain them unless they remain consistent across multiple reports.
Match the ATA and ADT data of each vessel in chronological order:

Sort ATA and ADT data for each vessel based on the call sign.
Pair ATA and ADT records chronologically where the ATA precedes the ADT and the time difference between them is less than 3 days.
Match the ATA and EDT data of each vessel in chronological order:

Sort ATA and EDT data for each vessel based on the call sign.
Pair ATA and EDT records chronologically where the upload time of the EDT data plus one day is earlier than the ATA data and the time difference between the upload time of the EDT and ATA data is less than 5 days.
Delete ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT:

Remove ATA records that do not have corresponding ADT and EDT records after the pairing process.
Follow these steps carefully, ensuring that your preprocessing matches the methodology described in the paper. This will help prepare your dataset for further analysis and modeling.

I have done most steps already. We should now continue to step 7. The paper says this about it: Delete ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT Upon completing the pairing process, any ATA records without the corresponding ADT and EDT are considered erroneous and are deleted. This circumstance might occur because either thesystem records the vessel’s ATA but fails to record the corresponding EDT or ADT, or the vessel remains docked at the port and thus does don the corresponding ADT and EDT data.

Can you write me some code that merges these CSVs based on unique ATA - callsign records? Rows without either ATD or ETD data should be removed.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Below is some Python code using pandas library to merge the CSV files based on unique ATA-call sign records and remove rows without either ATD or ETD data:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV files
ata_atd_df = pd.read_csv("ATA_ATD_matched.csv")
ata_etd_df = pd.read_csv("ATA_ETD_matched.csv")

# Merge the dataframes based on unique ATA-call sign records
merged_df = pd.merge(ata_atd_df, ata_etd_df, on=["CALL_SIGN", "ATA_TIME"], how="outer")

# Remove rows without either ATD or ETD data
merged_df = merged_df.dropna(subset=["ATD_TIME", "ETD_TIME"])

# Display the resulting merged dataframe
print(merged_df.head())

# Save the merged dataframe to a new CSV file
merged_df.to_csv("merged_data.csv", index=False)
This code reads the two CSV files into pandas dataframes, merges them based on unique ATA-call sign records using an outer join, and then removes rows without either ATD or ETD data. Finally, it prints the first few rows of the resulting merged dataframe and saves it to a new CSV file named "merged_data.csv".

We have now done the preprocessing steps. We now need to go on to feature engineering. For step 4, feature engineering, the paper writes down this:

<start of description of feature engineering>
4.1. Feature engineering
Feature engineering is the process of leveraging domain knowledge to create more effective representations that capture the essence of a problem, with the goal of enhancing a model’s predictive capabilities. There are three key steps involved in our feature engineering process, namely feature selection, categorical feature encoding, and dataset splitting. ‘‘Feature selection’’ aims to identify the most relevant variables for prediction. ‘‘Categorical feature encoding’’ transforms categorical data into numerical format so that models can process them. Finally, ‘‘dataset splitting’’ divides the data into separate sets for training and testing, ensuring that the model can be trained and validated effectively. Each of these steps is explained in detail below.

4.1.1. Feature selection
To predict VTT, we assess and integrate five categories of features into vessel arrival dataset to establish a comprehensive training set: vessel generic features, temporal features, berth operational features and waterway characteristics. The actual VTT is designated as the ground truth label. The features used to construct the machine learning prediction model are detailed in Table 7 (this table names vessel generic features: beam, GT, length, max_draft, vesseltype; temporal features: ATA_day, ATA_hour, EDT_day, EDT_hour, EDT_season, ATA_season, Expected VTT; Berth operational features: ATA_inport, ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, vessel_delay; Waterway features: tidal level; Prediction target: Actual VTT). We have evaluated these features based on their demonstrated influence on VTT through factor analysis, ensuring each one contributes meaningfully to the predictive accuracy of our model. Below, we provide a rationale for including these particular features from the perspective of their influence on VTT and detail the specific parameters selected for our case study, along with the source data from which they are obtained, ensuring a comprehensive and data-driven approach to predicting VTT.

4.1.2. Temporal features
Temporal features like EDT and ATA significantly impact VTT. EDTs help in resource planning and allocation, ensuring efficient berth utilization. Therefore, deviations from these estimates can cause delays, affecting subsequent vessel schedules and increasing turnaround times. ATAs, indicating the vessel’s actual arrival, can disrupt operations if significantly different from expected times, leading to rushed or delayed operations and inefficient use of resources. Accurate EDT and ATA are vital for effective scheduling and coordination, allowing for predictive planning and thus better management of vessel flows. Expected VTT can be calculated from ATA and ETD and serves as an essential basis for VTT evaluation and prediction. Moreover, port operational efficiency and busyness vary across different weeks, time slots, and seasons. Temporal features in ETD and ATA can serve as a basis to better assess VTT, accommodating for these variations and improving the overall efficiency and predictability of port operations. In the case study, the vessel arrival and departure information provided by the Hong Kong Marine Department website includes these time-related temporal information (e.g., ETA, ATA and their upload time) for ships in port.

4.1.3. Categorical feature encoding
Feature encoding of categorical data is a critical component of the data engineering pipeline (Zheng and Casari, 2018). Categorical data are non-numeric and often subdivided into groups. Consider, for example, the category of ‘‘vessel type’’. This is a form of categorical data that includes categories such as ‘‘container vessel’’, ‘‘bulk vessel’’ and ‘‘chemical tanker vessels’’. These values are maintained in a string format. Such features cannot be directly processed by machine learning algorithms. In this way, categorical feature encoding is employed to convert these strings into numbers suitable for input into machine learning models. Given the nature of the categorical data involved in this study, we primarily employ the following two feature encoding methods, one hot encoding and label encoding:
(1) One hot encoding: For a feature with m categories without order between them, after One hot encoding processing, that feature is extended to m new binary features and the original feature is deleted, with each new feature corresponding to a category. The m binary features are mutually exclusive and only one of them is set to 1 considering the real feature value, with 0 given to all of the (m − 1) features.
(2) Label encoding: In label encoding, we assign labels according to a hierarchy. For a feature with m categories, each category is mapped to a number between 0 and m − 1 after label encoding. The larger the assigned value, the higher the hierarchy of the category (Zheng and Casari, 2018).

Timestamps such as ATA, EDT and upload_time cannot be directly inputted into the prediction model. To tackle the issue, First, we employ One hot encoding to categorize the specific days of the week for ATA and EDT. Following this, we divide the precise time of ATA and EDT into three distinct and complimentary shifts using label encoding. These shifts are classified as: Shift 1 (from 0:00 to 8:00), Shift 2 (from 8:00 to 16:00) and Shift 3 (from 16:00 to 24:00) (Yu et al., 2018). We also used one hot encoding to label the season information corresponding to the ATA and EDT: December, January and February are labeled as winter, March, April and May as spring, June, July and August as summer, and September, October and November as autumn. The description of the categorical features is illustrated in Table 8.

4.1.4. Dataset splitting
HKP is primarily a container port that provides services to container vessels including container loading and unloading, which involves berth and crane allocation amongst other port operations. In this research, we mainly explore the prediction of VTT for container vessels at the HKP. Before splitting the dataset, we first filter out container vessels from all arriving ships based on the vessel type. Initially, there are 14,975 entries of vessel arrival data. After the filtering process, we have 10,001 records related to container vessels. Given that our dataset involves historical delay data related to vessels and berths, we cannot split the data randomly as is traditionally done. Instead, We use the 2022 ship arrival data as the training set and data from January 2023 to March 2023 as the test set. After this division, the training set consists of 8,178 data records and the prediction set consists of 1,823 data records.

Can you guide me through this feature engineering as done in the paper, step by step?

ChatGPT
Sure! Let's break down the feature engineering process described in the paper and guide you through each step:

4.1.1. Feature Selection
Identify and integrate five categories of features into the vessel arrival dataset to establish a comprehensive training set:
Vessel generic features
Temporal features
Berth operational features
Waterway characteristics
Designate the actual VTT as the ground truth label.
Detailed features used to construct the machine learning prediction model are mentioned in Table 7 of the paper.
4.1.2. Temporal Features
Temporal features like EDT and ATA significantly impact VTT.
Features like EDT, ATA, and their upload times are essential for predicting VTT.
Expected VTT can be calculated from ATA and ETD and serves as an essential basis for VTT evaluation and prediction.
Consider variations in port operational efficiency across different weeks, time slots, and seasons.
Encode temporal features such as days of the week, time shifts, and seasons using one hot encoding and label encoding.
4.1.3. Categorical Feature Encoding
Categorical data, such as vessel type, needs to be encoded into numerical format for machine learning models.
Use one hot encoding and label encoding methods:
One hot encoding: For features without order between categories.
Label encoding: Assign labels according to hierarchy for features with multiple categories.
Encode timestamp features like ATA, EDT, and upload_time using one hot encoding for days of the week and label encoding for time shifts and seasons.
4.1.4. Dataset Splitting
Filter out container vessels from all arriving ships based on vessel type.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
Use 2022 ship arrival data as the training set.
Use data from January 2023 to March 2023 as the test set.
Ensure that historical delay data related to vessels and berths are appropriately handled.
After splitting, verify the size of the training and testing sets.
Implementation Notes:
Make sure to map each step of feature selection and encoding to the specific features mentioned in Table 7 and Table 8 of the paper.
Use pandas and scikit-learn libraries in Python to implement feature engineering steps.
Document each step and rationale for future reference and reproducibility.
By following these steps, you can effectively engineer features for your machine learning model to predict vessel turnaround time (VTT) as described in the paper.

I think we should start with merging all my datasets to get all features as described by the paper (vessel generic features: beam, GT, length, max_draft, vesseltype; temporal features: ATA_day, ATA_hour, EDT_day, EDT_hour, EDT_season, ATA_season, Expected VTT; Berth operational features: ATA_inport, ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, vessel_delay; Waterway features: tidal level; Prediction target: Actual VTT)

The paper writes this about the ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay and vessel_delay features:

<start of section from the paper>
The average vessel delay refers to the average VTT delay for the particular vessel in the dataset, which is updated each time when the vessel arrives at the port. The average berth delay is divided into ATA berth delay and EDT berth delay. ATA berth delay refers to the average VTT delay time for the berth at which the vessel arrives. The EDT berth delay refers to the average VTT delay time for the berth at which the vessel reports its EDT. The specific method for calculating the delay is defined as follows: if a vessel is associated with multiple arrival reports in the dataset, the delay data related to the first arrival is the absolute difference between the vessel ADT and the corresponding EDT. For the second arrival, the delay value is the average of the VTT delay for the first two arrivals. This pattern continues, with each subsequent delay value being calculated as the average delay of all previous arrivals.

Now, you have all the desired features in one database (DataFrame) merged_data. You can further manipulate or analyze this data as needed for your prediction model. Additionally, ensure to handle missing values and process the data as per the requirements of your predictive modeling task.

User
please provide me with the logic to calculate ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, and vessel_delay as described in the paper
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's define the logic to calculate ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, and vessel_delay as described in the paper:

ATA_berth_delay:
ATA_berth_delay refers to the average VTT delay time for the berth at which the vessel arrives.
To calculate ATA_berth_delay:
For each vessel arrival:
Find the corresponding ATA_BERTH and ATD_TIME.
Calculate the delay as the absolute difference between ATD_TIME and ATA_TIME.
Aggregate the delay values for each unique ATA_BERTH to get the average ATA_berth_delay for that berth.
EDT_berth_delay:
EDT_berth_delay refers to the average VTT delay time for the berth at which the vessel reports its EDT.
To calculate EDT_berth_delay:
For each vessel arrival:
Find the corresponding ETD_BERTH and ETD_TIME.
Calculate the delay as the absolute difference between ETD_TIME and ATA_TIME.
Aggregate the delay values for each unique ETD_BERTH to get the average EDT_berth_delay for that berth.
Vessel_delay:
Vessel_delay refers to the average VTT delay for the particular vessel in the dataset.
To calculate Vessel_delay:
For each vessel:
Consider all the arrivals of that vessel.
For each arrival (except the first one):
Calculate the delay as the absolute difference between ADT_TIME and the corresponding EDT_TIME.
Aggregate the delay values for all arrivals of the vessel and calculate the average Vessel_delay.
Here's a Python code snippet to implement this logic:

python
Copy code
# Calculate ATA_berth_delay
ata_berth_delay = merged_data.groupby("ATA_BERTH").apply(lambda x: (x["ATD_TIME"] - x["ATA_TIME"]).mean()).reset_index()
ata_berth_delay.columns = ["ATA_BERTH", "ATA_berth_delay"]

# Calculate EDT_berth_delay
edt_berth_delay = merged_data.groupby("ETD_BERTH").apply(lambda x: (x["ATD_TIME"] - x["ATA_TIME"]).mean()).reset_index()
edt_berth_delay.columns = ["ETD_BERTH", "EDT_berth_delay"]

# Calculate Vessel_delay
vessel_delay = merged_data.groupby("CALL_SIGN").apply(lambda x: (x["ATD_TIME"] - x["ETD_TIME"].shift()).mean()).reset_index()
vessel_delay.columns = ["CALL_SIGN", "Vessel_delay"]
Make sure to execute this code after merging the relevant datasets and having the necessary columns available (ATA_TIME, ATD_TIME, ETD_TIME, ATA_BERTH, ETD_BERTH, CALL_SIGN, etc.). This logic will compute the average delay for each berth and each vessel as described in the paper.

User
write me one snippet that I can copy, that does all the above
ChatGPT
Sure! Here's a single code snippet that combines all the steps to calculate ATA_berth_delay, EDT_berth_delay, and vessel_delay:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Read datasets

all_shipdata = pd.read_csv("all_shipdata_final.csv")
inport_count = pd.read_csv("inport_count.csv")
ata_tidal_final = pd.read_csv("ata_tidal_final.csv")

# Merge datasets
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, all_shipdata, left_on="CALL_SIGN", right_on="CALL_SIGN", how="left")
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, inport_count, on="ATA_TIME", how="left")
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, ata_tidal_final, on="ATA_TIME", how="left")

# Calculate ATA_inport
merged_data["ATA_inport"] = merged_data["ATD_TIME"].notna().astype(int)

# Calculate ATA_berth_delay
ata_berth_delay = merged_data.groupby("ATA_BERTH").apply(lambda x: (x["ATD_TIME"] - x["ATA_TIME"]).mean()).reset_index()
ata_berth_delay.columns = ["ATA_BERTH", "ATA_berth_delay"]

# Calculate EDT_berth_delay

# Calculate Vessel_delay
vessel_delay = merged_data.groupby("CALL_SIGN").apply(lambda x: (x["ATD_TIME"] - x["ETD_TIME"].shift()).mean()).reset_index()
vessel_delay.columns = ["CALL_SIGN", "Vessel_delay"]

# Display the results

print(ata_berth_delay.head())
print("\nEDT_berth_delay:")
print(edt_berth_delay.head())
print("\nVessel_delay:")
print(vessel_delay.head())
This snippet will read all the necessary datasets, merge them together, calculate the required features, and display the results. Make sure to replace the file paths with the actual paths to your datasets.

It seems that the error is due to the fact that the "ATA_TIME" and "ATD_TIME" columns are in string format, and you're trying to perform arithmetic operations directly on them. Before calculating the mean difference between the times, you should first convert these columns to datetime objects.

Here's the modified code snippet that includes the conversion of time columns to datetime objects:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Read datasets
merged_data = pd.read_csv("merged_data.csv")
all_shipdata = pd.read_csv("all_shipdata_final.csv")
inport_count = pd.read_csv("inport_count.csv")
ata_tidal_final = pd.read_csv("ata_tidal_final.csv")

# Merge datasets
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, all_shipdata, left_on="CALL_SIGN", right_on="CALL_SIGN", how="left")
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, inport_count, on="ATA_TIME", how="left")
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, ata_tidal_final, on="ATA_TIME", how="left")

# Convert time columns to datetime objects
merged_data["ATA_TIME"] = pd.to_datetime(merged_data["ATA_TIME"])
merged_data["ATD_TIME"] = pd.to_datetime(merged_data["ATD_TIME"])
merged_data["ETD_TIME"] = pd.to_datetime(merged_data["ETD_TIME"])

# Calculate ATA_inport
merged_data["ATA_inport"] = merged_data["ATD_TIME"].notna().astype(int)

# Calculate ATA_berth_delay
ata_berth_delay = merged_data.groupby("ATA_BERTH").apply(lambda x: (x["ATD_TIME"] - x["ATA_TIME"]).mean()).reset_index()
ata_berth_delay.columns = ["ATA_BERTH", "ATA_berth_delay"]

# Calculate EDT_berth_delay
edt_berth_delay = merged_data.groupby("ETD_BERTH").apply(lambda x: (x["ATD_TIME"] - x["ATA_TIME"]).mean()).reset_index()
edt_berth_delay.columns = ["ETD_BERTH", "EDT_berth_delay"]

# Calculate Vessel_delay
vessel_delay = merged_data.groupby("CALL_SIGN").apply(lambda x: (x["ATD_TIME"] - x["ETD_TIME"].shift()).mean()).reset_index()
vessel_delay.columns = ["CALL_SIGN", "Vessel_delay"]

# Display the results
print("ATA_berth_delay:")
print(ata_berth_delay.head())
print("\nEDT_berth_delay:")
print(edt_berth_delay.head())
print("\nVessel_delay:")
print(vessel_delay.head())
This should resolve the TypeError you encountered. Now, the time columns are converted to datetime objects before performing any arithmetic operations.
